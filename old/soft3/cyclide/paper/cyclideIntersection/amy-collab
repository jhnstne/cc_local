% Amy and I worked on the center of the inverse of a circle,
% and more globally on finding the directrix curve (curve of centers) 
% of a cyclide via mapping of directrix curve of torus or cylinder
% The theme was `directrix curves of lower degree than the surface'
% (e.g., line directrix on quadric ruled, conic directrix on cyclide)
% which I believed was a good way of reducing the complexity of the 
% computations on a surface.
