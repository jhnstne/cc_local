\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

Re: A new intersection algorithm for cyclides and swept surfaces using
	circle decomposition (COMAID 299)

I am writing about the above paper, which is being published in Computer
Aided Geometric Design.
I enclose the original photographs of Figure 1, which Michael Griffin
recently requested.
I have also enclosed the other figures in this paper, which I had not yet
sent to you.

I also enclose a copy of a letter to Gerald Farin, which explains that
I would like to make a small change to the final version of the paper
by removing Section 12.1.
I enclose the new version of the paper, with this section removed.
The paper is otherwise unchanged, except for the last bullet immediately
preceding Section 12.1: the reference to Section 12.1 has been replaced
by references to the literature.
Please notice that Figure 10 is no longer needed, and is not included
in the enclosed collection of figures, because it was only used in 
Section 12.1.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at jj@cs.jhu.edu
or (410) 516-5560 if you have any questions.
Thank you very much for your consideration of this matter.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
