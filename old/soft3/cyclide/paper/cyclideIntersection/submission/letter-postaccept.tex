\opening{Dear Prof. Farin:}

I would like to make a small change to the paper 
`A New Intersection Algorithm for Cyclides and Swept Surfaces
using Circle Decomposition' (COMAID 299), which has been 
accepted for publication.
I would like to remove the short discussion of offset computation
in Section 12.1, which is an independent comment that is unnecessary
in the rest of the paper.
The offset of a cyclide is well documented.
The resultant changes are the removal of Section 12.1 (along with its
Figure 10) and 
the addition of two references to the last bullet of Section 12 to replace
the discussion of Section 12.1.

In order to avoid confusion, I have enclosed a copy of the paper with these
additions (without figures).  
I have also sent a photocopy of this letter and a copy of the new paper
to Elsevier Publishers.
Please contact me at (410) 516-5560 or jj@cs.jhu.edu if you have any questions.
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
