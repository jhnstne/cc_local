\opening{Dear Prof. Barnhill:}

I enclose two copies of the paper 'A New Intersection Algorithm
using Circle Decomposition' for consideration for publication 
in Computer Aided Geometric Design.  This paper presents an algorithm
for the intersection of an extended class of surfaces called ringed surfaces
(which includes cyclides, quadrics, revolutes, and other surfaces)
with any cyclide.
In order to fulfill the requirements of your journal, I am also
sending two copies to Prof. Boehm.

Please contact me at (410) 516-5560 if you have any questions.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
