FUTURE PROBLEM:
Deal with parabolic cyclide in a separate paper: too deep a problem
to tackle in this paper.
Probably can represent by parabola directrix curve (probably can with 
parabola).

Our theory can probably handle parabolic cyclides and cylinders/cones, but 
	(a) the implicit form doesn't include them;
	(b) the classical definition of dupin cyclide does not include them;
	(c) a theory for the classic dupin cyclide is rich enough, especially
		as a first step.
The inclusion of parabolic cyclides is a topic for further consideration.

It is important to note that in this paper we only consider quartic Dupin 
cyclides:
we do not consider parabolic cyclides, which are infinite cubic surfaces that 
are the inversion of a torus such that the center of inversion lies 
on the torus \cite{F12,FISCH86}.	% p. 328 of Forsyth: cubic surface;
					% Fischer, p. 
% 	parabolic cyclides still have circular lines of curvature, see p. 328
%	of Forsyth where he discusses principal radii of curvature
% 	BUT ARE THESE EVER 0?
	% parabolic cyclides contain lines 
	% because all circles of the torus through the center of inversion  
	% (parabolic cyclides arise from inversion of a torus where the
	% center of inversion lies on the torus: see fischer)
	% get mapped to lines
	% DOES THIS MEAN THEY CONTAIN LINEAR LINES OF CURVATURE?
	% are lines of curvature preserved under inversion (since
	% we know some lines of curvature on the torus get mapped to lines)?
	% parabolic cyclides are cubic surfaces, too (p. 286, Dutta; 
	% p. 328, Forsyth)
SHOULD CONSIDER PARABOLIC CYCLIDES SINCE THEY CAN BE INVERTED TO A TORUS,
WHICH IS ALL THAT WE REQUIRE OF A SURFACE.
