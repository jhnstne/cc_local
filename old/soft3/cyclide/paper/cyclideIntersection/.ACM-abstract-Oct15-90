Abstract: One way to introduce complicated surfaces into the working 
language of solid modeling is to express them in terms of simple curves
and surfaces.  This simplification or decomposition can be helpful
even if the surface is well understood, because it offers an alternative
way of dealing with the surface.  In this paper, we consider the Dupin
cyclide and its expression in terms of a conic.

The Dupin cyclide has received considerable attention in the recent
literature, as a surface patch, as a blending surface, and in general
as a subclass of quartic surfaces with useful properties.
A Dupin cyclide is the only surface whose lines of curvature are all circular.
Thus, it is clear that it can be generated by circles.
More surprisingly, we prove in this paper that it can be generated 
by sweeping a circle along a conic (i.e., sweeping a circle so that its
center always lies on a conic).
Equally importantly, we show how to determine the exact relationship between 
a cyclide and its associated conic, and we show how to determine how the 
circle changes as it sweeps along this conic.

Our reduction of a cyclide to a circle sweeping along a conic
is intimately related to the well-known description of a cyclide
as the inverse of a torus, cylinder, or cone.
(Notice that the torus, cylinder, and cone can clearly be generated by
sweeping a circle along a conic.)
Because of this approach, the paper must develop results on inversion.
One of the key results is the algebraic similarity between the
inverse of a point and the central inverse of a point, where
central inversion is the mapping between the center of a circle
and the center of its inverse.
