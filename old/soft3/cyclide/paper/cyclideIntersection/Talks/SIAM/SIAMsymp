Abstract:

In the search for a wider vocabulary of shapes for solid modeling,
researchers are starting to consider the cyclide.
The cyclide is a tractable class of (usually) quartic surfaces,
an extension of the popular torus primitive, 
with many useful properties.  
This minisymposium will cover all of the major aspects of the cyclide, 
from its geometry to patching with cyclides, blending, and
its generalization to a larger class of surfaces.
Early work on the cyclide in geometric modeling centered 
around its use as a surface patch.
One of the main advantages of the cyclide is that it is a natural blending
surface.

Purpose: The cyclide is an important and emerging surface for design.

Intended Audience: Solid and surface modelers; participants with an interest
in blending, patching, and the geometry of surfaces.
