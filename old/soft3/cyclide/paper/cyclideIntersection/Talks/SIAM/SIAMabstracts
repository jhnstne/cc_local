Subject: Speaker abstracts for `Cyclides' minisymposium
Date: Tue, 30 Apr 91 09:26:45 EDT




Dear Sir or Madam: 
	
	Earlier this month I submitted a proposal for a minisymposium
on `Cyclides' for the Second SIAM Conference on Geometric Design.
At that time, I promised to send the full speakers abstracts for all 
four talks by the end of the month.  I enclose the promised abstracts.
(I had already sent you Dutta's abstract: it has not changed but I enclose
it for completeness.)  Thank you for your consideration to this matter.

				Prof. John K. Johnstone
				Chair of the `Cyclides' Minisymposium



Abstract for First talk

Title: 		Circles and the geometry of cyclides
Abstract: 

This talk will discuss the geometry of the Dupin cyclide.
One of its themes will be the 
connection between the Dupin cyclide and the circle.
We will show that the extension of the vocabulary from quadrics
to cyclides is very natural, because cyclides are natural generalizations
of quadrics.
The cyclide will be introduced and some of its classical properties will
be reviewed.
Methods for decomposing the cyclide into circles,
properties of these circles, 
and applications of this decomposition, such as intersection and offsetting,
will be studied.
The relevance of inversion in the study of cyclides will be underlined.

Abstract for Second talk

Title: 		Patching with cyclides
Abstract: 

This talk considers the properties of individual Dupin's Cyclide patches,
and how they may be put together to make up a composite surface, including
default choices for patches and optimisation of designs. Other topics of
interest when modeling surfaces will also be discussed, including the
intersection of cyclide surfaces, joining cyclide surfaces together, local
modification of composite cyclide surfaces, and offset surfaces.

Abstract for Third talk

Title: 		Variable Radius Blending and Dupin Cyclides

Abstract: 

Variable radius blends are commonly found in a wide
variety of mechanical parts including molds and dies.
Such blending surfaces are mathematically complex and
of high algebraic degree. This motivates approximating
them by lower degree algebraic surfaces. A candidate 
for the approximant is the Dupin cyclide. Discovered
by Charles P. Dupin in 1822, this quartic surface has
circular lines of curvature and is closed under offsetting.
This talk will focus on the use of cyclides for approximating
variable radius blends.

Abstract for Fourth talk

Title: 	`The Future of Cyclides in CAGD' 
	(previously entitled `Generalizations of the cyclide')

Abstract: 	

This talk will cover the following points:
(1) The virtues of cyclides in CAD in having low algebraic degree and
	concise geometric representation.
(2) The existence of exact C^{1} blends between any pair of cyclides
    (including natural quadrics), made up either of a single third cyclide
    or a further pair of cyclides.
(3) Generalisation of the above to cope with the blending of three
    surfaces and configurations containing umbilical points.
(4) Possibilities of widening the class of surfaces which may be used 
    in this way; in particular, a review of the properties of a class
    of generalised cyclides discovered by Degen.
