Title: A New Intersection Algorithm using Circle Decomposition

The present vocabulary of a solid modeler is canonically the plane,
(some subset of) the quadrics, and the torus.
The class of cyclides is also becoming important.
Quadrics and cyclides lie in the more general class of ringed surfaces:
surfaces that can be swept out by a circle.
This class also contains the important class of revolute surfaces.
We will present a method for the exact intersection of any ringed surface with
any quadric or cyclide.
This algorithm shows that it is feasible to expand the 
vocabulary of solid modeling primitives to include all ringed surfaces.
(In solid modeling, surface intersection is crucial to the design of solids
and their subsequent analysis.)

Our intersection algorithm is exact: 
that is, the intersection is computed symbolically rather than numerically.
The theme of exact intersection is to reduce to degree 4 computations.
We do this by concentrating on the decomposition of a surface into simpler
components (whereas previous algorithmic development has centered around 
the degree of an algebraic surface).
Two keys to our algorithm are circle decomposition and inversion.
We will develop the circle decomposition of a cyclide 
(i.e., its description as a union of circles).
and results on the inverse of any circle.
