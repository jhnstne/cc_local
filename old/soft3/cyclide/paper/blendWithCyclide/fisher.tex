\opening{Dear Prof. Fisher:}

I enclose the final version of the paper `Dupin cyclides as blending
surfaces for cones' by J. Johnstone and C.-K. Shene.
I have sent the Latex version earlier by electronic mail.

The figures are included separately from the paper, and they are of
two types: figures and photographs.
Both figures and photographs are numbered on the back in the top right corner 
with their number. 
In order to make it entirely clear how the figures should be inserted,
I have also included a copy of the earlier version of the paper with figures
included (the version sent to the referees).  
Since this version differs from the final version in some cosmetic
details (e.g., the format of the bibliography), please only use it
to verify positioning of the figures.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me
at (410) 516-5560 or communicate with me via electronic mail
at jj@cs.jhu.edu.
Thank you very much for your attention to these matters.

\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
