\opening{Dear Michael:}

I wanted to let you know that we are still working on the paper
on blending cones with cyclides.
We have finished the theoretical development but not yet written it up fully.
The eventual result is a full proof that 
two cones can be blended by a Dupin cyclide
if and only if they have planar intersections, 
along with some observations arising from our solution.
Through several iterations, the proof has been tightened considerably.
I will definitely send you a copy when all is written up.

One of the observations we make concerns the Cranfield object.
Would it be possible for you to send me a picture of the Cranfield object
or, if this is impossible, would you give us permission to use
your picture in the CAGD article
from `Cyclides in computer aided geometric design' (CAGD 1990)
or `Applications of cyclide surfaces in geometric modelling'?

Hope that all is well with you.

\closing{All of the best,}
\end{letter}
