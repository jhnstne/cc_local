FOR JOURNAL:

Should we try to show how to construct the cyclide from the three circles
(e.g., how to retrieve the type information to translate into implicit eqn)?
Can we do it? SAVE FOR JOURNAL

I still don't understand this:
Since these two cyclides have the same principal circles and center of
similitude $X^\prime$, they are identical.
NEED TO ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE SAME DIRECTRIX CONIC, BUT THIS GETS MESSY.
DISCUSS WITH CK AFTER.

Proof of Lemma 4.7:
Why does the cyclide contain the circle (know that principal circle is
tangent and principal line is too):
IT TAKES A SWEEPING ARGUMENT: ELABORATE LATER
Therefore, the cone ${\cal C}_1$ is tangent
to the parabolic cyclide along the circle with diameter $\overline{AB}$ and
perpendicular to the axial plane: the cyclide and cone both contain this circle
and, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:on-principal-line}, 
the cyclide is tangent to the cone along the circle.


Figure 1 is misleading concerning the horizontal and vertical symm
planes, since they are not horiz and vertical.

Figure of horiz plane with its two circles would be useful.

should motivate the focal length formulas on p. 10 (in proof) at least a bit

Put in conclusions:
CK: what do we think about blending of other quadrics by cyclides? (obvious question): cannot be done using Humbert: only revolute quadrics (see scrap paper)



SMALL CORRECTIONS


p. 1, par 1: change Dupin cyclide is in general nonsingular to
	nonsingular in real space [since it has singularities on double
	conic in complex space]  NOT CHANGED

p. 3, par 1: network of cyclides -> use piecewise cyclide instead
	(look in new Pratt paper:  Math Method of CAGD)  NOT CHANGED

*******

use C3 rather than D in Lemma 4.1 (more intuitive, unless D
	is used to indicate that it is in diff family)
	NOT DONE BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES INDICATE DIFF FAMILY
	(AND BECAUSE DIFFICULT CHANGE)

MOVE EXAMPLES TO AN EARLIER SECTION??	NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE (NOW ANYWAY)
Do in journal version.

after Lemma 4.1 statement, but before its Proof, add a Remark:
	most of the restrictions on the third circle D are natural:
	see explanation of first two restrictions in IMA talk slides.

	NOT ADDED: ADD IN JOURNAL VERSION (ALMOST CLEAR AND DON'T HAVE THE
	TIME)
