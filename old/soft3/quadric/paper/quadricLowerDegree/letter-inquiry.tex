\noindent \opening{Dear Dr. Rossignac:}

I would like to inquire about the
paper `On the Lower Degree Intersections of Two Natural Quadrics'
by C.-K. Shene and J.K. Johnstone (paper TOG 92-1) submitted
to Transactions on Graphics.
We submitted a revised version of this paper on June 7, 1993
addressing the referees' comments, which had been generally
very favourable.  
Would it be possible for you to let me know the status of this
paper?
Thank you very much.
Please feel free to call me at (410) 516-5560 if you wish.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
