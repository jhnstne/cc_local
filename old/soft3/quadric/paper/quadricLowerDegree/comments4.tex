My final comments!  The paper looks excellent now.
I will send you the letter to Rossignac in the next file.

I added the remark after Defn 3.2, along with a mention of disjointness.

Section 2, 5th paragraph, last sentence: I replaced 
	`are more robust to transformations (rotations, translations)'
	by `are more robust',
	since we don't need a representation that is directly robust
	to transformations but rather one that has advantages such
	as direct representation of radius and axis, for example.
	I then referred the reader to the following remark, where
	robustness is discussed in more detail.

Section 2, added remark:
	I agree that the remark was too long, so I have shortened it
	(shortened steps 1 and 2, removed Goldman quote, and shortened
	discussion of other problems).
	The letter to Rossignac will have a longer version with most 
	of these details kept in.

I removed the `to appear' from reference 38.

In the letter to Rossignac, I would like to include some evidence
that step 1 would be expensive, if possible.
Thus, at the end of the comments on step 1 in the letter, something like
`For example, all normalizations in Snyder and Sisam
are expensive.'  What references would you suggest?

I removed the final paragraph of your reply to referee 2.
I think it is better to just ignore silly remarks such as his last comments.
