In general, two natural quadrics intersect in a space quartic curve.
However, the intersection frequently degenerates to a collection of plane 
curves.
In a previous paper, the present authors have given some geometric algorithms 
to detect and calculate these planar intersections.
In this talk, we will explore the problem further.
Our algorithms will reduce the problem to a plane.
We begin with a characterization of conic intersection by focal length,
using the Dandelin sphere.
We next consider the following problem.
Suppose that one cone is fixed, as well as one of the intersection conics C.
Where can the vertex of the other cone lie?
We will show that the locus of the vertex of the other cone is the
perpendicular focal conic of C.
(Two conics are perpendicular focal conics if they lie in perpendicular planes
and each conic passes through the foci of the other conic.)
This leads to another simple algorithm for detection and computation of
conic intersection.
These methods show promise of providing a method that is extendible to 
other quadrics.
We will also give a complete enumeration of the type of the conic 
intersections, based on the relative positions of the two cone vertices.
Finally, we shall discuss results on the blending of two 
natural quadrics with planar intersection.
