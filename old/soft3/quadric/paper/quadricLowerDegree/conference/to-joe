Joe: Good to hear from you and thanks for 
the update on your progress.  
Let me describe our use of the inscribed sphere.
In our paper, we introduced the inscribed sphere
in order to get a cleaner condition equivalent to
one in the paper by Goldman/Miller.
We have not looked at the extension of this portion
of the paper to general quadrics, or its use as 
a sufficient condition.  It was very interesting to 
later see your use of the inscribing sphere.
Our reference to extending the method was with regard
to the method for computing planar intersections
using the height test, which was the main thrust
of the paper.

Given this, it would be unfair for us to 
take you up on the offer of coauthorship.
But I certainly appreciate your offer.

It is interesting that both papers arrived at the
use of inscribed spheres although the two papers
are very different in other respects.

We are making good progress on extensions of our
paper to more general quadrics, using the height test
and other related methods for computing the planar intersection.
When we get it written up, we will send you a copy.

I would be interested to know what your generalization 
of the axis is for general quadrics.
If you could send me a copy when it's written, I would definitely
like to see it.

All of the best, 
John
