      CONNECTIONS TO BLENDING

\begin{itemize}
     \item {\bf Monge--Warren}: Two quadric surfaces intersect in conics if
          and only if there exists a common inscribed or  circumscribed
          quadric surface.
     \item {\bf Sabin}: Two cones intersect in conics if and only if they have
          a cyclide as their blending surface.
     \item Two cones intersect in conics if and only if they have a constant
          radius sphere blending with directrix on a conic.
\end{itemize}

\centerline{\bf Some Notes}
\Large
\begin{enumerate}
     \item The Monge--Warren result is not geometric.  For cylinders and
          and cones, a simple geometric method is available.
     \item The Warren result can be proved {\em without} ideal theory.
          A simple argument based on B\'{e}zout theorem is available and this
          can be generalized to general algebraic surfaces.
     \item The cones in Sabin's result is semi-cones.  Furthermore, the
          definition of blending is different from the one given by
          Hoffmann-Hopcroft--Warren.  Thus, in the HHW sense, only one of the
          two intersection conics can be blended with cyclide.
\end{enumerate}
