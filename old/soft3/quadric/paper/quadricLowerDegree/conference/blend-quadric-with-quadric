Subject: blending surfaces of a pair of general quadric surfaces
Date: Thu, 08 Aug 91 16:52:04 EDT



	Here is an extremely simple and yet constructive proof of the following
	result:

		TWO QUADRIC SURFACES HAVE QUADRIC BLENDING SURFACES IF
		AND ONLY IF THEY HAVE PLANAR INTERSECTION.

	(-->)  This is the Modge theorem.  However, we could make it more
	constructive.  Let Q1 and Q2 be the two given quadric surfaces.
	If Q is one of the quadric blending surfaces, then Q\cap Q1 (resp., 
	Q\cap Q2) consists of a double conic and thus lies on a plane P1
	(resp., P2).  Using the language of pencil theory, this is equivalent
	to there exists a p1 such that Q+p1 Q1=P1^2 holds.  The same holds
	for Q and Q2.  That is, there exists a p2 such that Q+p2 Q2=P2^2
	holds.  Subtracting these two equations we have

		p1 Q1 + p2 Q2 = P1^2 - P2^2
                              = (P1-P2)(P1+P2)

	Therefore P1-P2 and P1+P2 are the plan members of the pencil of
	Q1 and Q2.  Hence Q1 and Q2 have planar intersection.


	(<--)  Suppose Q1 and Q2 have planar intersection.  Then the following
	holds,

	(1)	q1 Q1 + q2 Q2 = P1*P2,

	where q1 and q2 are constants, while P1 and P2 are planes.
	Suppose Q is a quadric blending surface of Q1 and Q2.  Note that Q is
	unknow.  Then we have

		Q + r1 Q1 = (\lambda P1+\mu P2)^2
		Q + r2 Q2 = (\lambda P2-\mu P2)^2

	where P1 and P2 are the plane contain the tangent conic of Q\cap Q1 and
	Q\cap Q2 respectively, \lmabda and \mu are two numbers defferent
	from zero, and r1 and r2 are unknowns.  Substracting these two gives

	(2)	r1 Q1 - r2 Q2 = 4\lambda\mu P1 P2

	Comparing (1) and (2) we have

		r1 =  4\lambda\mu q1
		r2 = -4\lambda\mu q2

	Therefore the blending surface is

		Q = (\lambda P1+\mu P2)^2 - 4\lambda\mu q1 Q1
		  = (\lambda P1-\mu P2)^2 + 4\lambda\mu q2 Q2.

	QED

		This proof is constructive.  Notice that because by computing
	the planar member P1 and P2, all quadric blending surfaces can be
	determined by \lambda and \mu.

		A detailed memo will be ready leter.
