Subject: Quadric intersections




Hi.  How have things been going?
Ron showed me a copy of a paper
that you had done on planar intersections
for natural quadrics. In that paper, you
mentioned extending the work to general
quadrics. Ron and I had also been
looking at planar intersections of 
general quadrics.  Ron sent you
a copy of the paper that we've written up.
To summarize, we've found a
sufficient conditions for planar
intersection involving a sphere
inscribed in both quadrics.  We've
also come up with a few examples
that don't fit in with condition.

On glancing through your paper on natural
quadrics, I notice a similar condition
involving an inscribed sphere.  I suspect
our approaches are related.  Do you have
any interest in trying to do a joint
paper  with Ron and myself on planar
intersections of general quadrics?  
If so, we could create a new joint paper
that would subsume the paper that Ron sent you.
Otherwise, we'll probably just send what
we have got to a journal.

Mainly, I just wanted to check with you so that
there are no misunderstandings.  Let
me know if you're intereseted.

Joe
