Ms. Morton,

In reply to your query:

	We will submit a shortened version of `On the Lower
Degree Intersections of Two Natural Quadrics I: Algorithms"
by June 1, 1993.  I apologize for the delay in this submission:
the reviews were returned as the first author was finishing his
thesis and moving to a new university, making it hard for us
to communicate effectively over the planned revisions.
Thank you for your patience.

John K. Johnstone
