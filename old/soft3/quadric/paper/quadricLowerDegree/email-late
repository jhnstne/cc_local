Professor Johnstone --

I am in the process of following up on TOG papers which are overdue,
and your paper with Shing-Kuang Shene, "On the Lower Degree Inter-
sections of Two Natural Quadrics I:  Algorithms" is one of them.
According to our records, we sent the paper back to you for
revision on June 15, 1992 -- 9 months ago.  Do you plan to submit
a revision?  If you, can you please let us know when?  It was my
understanding that you were asked to shorten and combine it with 
the second part.  Since there are going to be some major changes,
would you prefer to withdraw the two manuscripts and just resubmit
the revision as a new manuscript?  Please let me know the current
status by April 6th.  Thank you.
