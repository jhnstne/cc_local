\begin{abstract}
A method of computing the intersection of a plane and a natural quadric 
surface is presented.  This problem is basic in geometric areas such as
solid modeling and descriptive geometry.
Our method, arising out of recent work on lower degree
intersections of quadrics, computes the directions of the axes of the 
intersection, and then computes their lengths using the Dandelin sphere.
The method also gives all parallel plane sections of the natural quadric,
with no added computation.
