\noindent \opening{Dear Ms. Patricola:}

I enclose the revised paper entitled
`Computing the Intersection of a Plane and a Natural Quadric' by
John K. Johnstone and C.-K. Shene, which is to be published in 
Volume 16, Number 2, 1992.
Two revisions were requested: to make the document double-spaced 
and to replace Figure 2.
I have enclosed copies of all figures.
Please notice that Figures 2, 3 and 4 have changed.
Figure 3 was changed at the request of a reviewer, and 
both Figure 3 and 4 have added captions.
Finally, we have added one citation (which causes a renumbering of citations
in the text) and one sentence to the main text.
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

Please do not hesitate to call me at (410) 516-5560 if you have any questions.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
