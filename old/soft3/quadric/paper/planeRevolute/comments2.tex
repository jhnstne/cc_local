CK, I have just made two changes.

p. 2: very minor change to added paragraph: `one can expect *that*'

p. 1 addition: on second thought, I wouldn't add this comment.
	It isn't quite correct.
	The main argument is that (1) plane sections are fundamental
	to solid modeling, and solid modeling is a subarea of graphics;
	(2) parallel sections are useful in visualization.
	We have already said this in the paper, so I would just
	point out the above argument in the letter.
	I have removed the last part of the sentence and added 'common'. 

The rest of the paper looks fine as is.
I have not removed the boldface anywhere.  The above two changes
are the only ones I have made.

John
