display of the six control points and weights of a rational triangular Bezier
patch of degree 2 (where do the weights come in?)

initial input of points: file

motion control over at least one of the points: since motion must be in 3d,
	we do not want to explicitly move the control point on the 2d screen;
	we can explicitly ask for new cartesian coordinates; 
	we can use widgets with +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z arrows with associated
		increments of small delta

automatic rendering of Bezier patch after each perturbation of the control net

start with ellipses rather than quadrics: 3 control points and curve
