The following changes address reviewer comment 3:

title: changed to 'The kernel of a freeform surface and its duality
	with a certain convex hull'
	
	This is a bit awkward, but I think it works.

p. 2: change to first line of 2nd paragraph, and last paragraph of Section 1

p. 3: last two sentences of Section 2 about dual relationship moved down 
	to preamble of Section 3

first sentence of Section 3.1 changed

last sentence of Conclusion changed

--------------------------------

To address comment 5, the images of Figure 5 must be scaled up.
I'm having trouble Latex'ing the document with the ps images: would you mind
adjust them to the right scale (something like scale=.5 or higher); 
this will undoubtedly push the second image onto a second row and so 
require adjustment of the spacing of (a) and (b) captions.  Thanks!

--------------------------------

the following change addresses comment 6:

immediately before Definition 2: added an explanatory sentence 
	about P and P^* (and S/S^*) 

--------------------------------

the following change addresses comment 7:

the definition of bitangent plane is moved up early in Section 3.2
(the definition of 'conventional bitangent plane' remains in the original place)

--------------------------------

the following change addresses comment 8:

The captions to Figure 5 and 6 are expanded.

--------------------------------

I added some discussion of complexity to address comment 9, immediately
before the conclusions.

Comment about other methods: I'm not aware of competing algorithms 
for computing kernels of *freeform* surfaces.

--------------------------------

added another grant to acknowledgements

--------------------------------

Comments 1, 2, and 4 address issues in the earlier part of the paper
(inflection points and gamma kernel) so you and Gershon can answer them
better.

I hope that covers it.  Please let me know if you have any followup
questions.  Would you please send me a copy of the paper when you have
incorporated your changes?  Thanks.
