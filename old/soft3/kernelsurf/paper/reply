Gershon and Myung-Soo,

Let me first address the reviewers' comments.
One of the reviewers had a problem with references.
It is integral to the kernel construction that we build
a (Bezier) surface in dual space, with a typical primal control structure.
The references they cite on developables use a curve in dual space to
represent a developable surface, which is not what we do.
Yes, this is a use of duality but otherwise different.
We need a surface in dual space (so that the hull can be computed) not a curve,
and a representation for arbitrary surfaces, not just developables.
I am not aware of any dual connection to the hull using a curve in dual space.
The most relevant reference is Hoschek's, which I would be glad to add
as background material (and do in the tangential surface paper), although
this again does not generate a primal control structure in dual space.
I am not aware of any previous work on the hull/kernel duality so I cannot
cite any suitable reference.  The only pointer to this fact was 
Wenping's observation after the Dagstuhl talk.
Finally, the reviewer wants an implementation of this work, 
which I do not presently have and couldn't complete before October 31.

Since the paper is too long by 13 pages, I offer to drop my section (7 pages).
I would appreciate it if you communicated the above comments to Stefanie
when you return the paper.

Myung-Soo, just read your email.
Your suggestion seems fine, given the hard page counts.
I'd be happy to submit the rest elsewhere, perhaps in 
the journals where you earlier submitted your recent intersection papers.

Best regards,
John
