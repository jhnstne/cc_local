Gershon and Myung-Soo,

Here is a draft of a section on the construction of kernels from hulls.
The development is a bit longer than anticipated, since
it is crucial to understand the degenerate structure of the hull
in dual space, in order to describe precisely 
(algorithmically) the kernel-hull dual relationship.
You might already have a (better) proof of 
Lemma 1.5, since this is based on an observation you made, Gershon,
in your Dagstuhl talk.  If so, please discard mine.

Best regards,
John
