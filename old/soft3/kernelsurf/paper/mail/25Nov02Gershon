I read about a half of your document last night and I really liked what I
read.  As myung Soo told you we are all starting to wrap everything up and
write it up.  I do have few minor comments to the document:

* In section 1.1 you state that "some tangent planes will inevitably
  map to infinity", only to state in the end of the papragraph that if
  the origin is located at the kernel no plane will be mapped to
  infinity.  This should be clarified a bit.

* Lemma 1.3 and its proof are certainly in line of what I had in mind.

* In Section 1.3 one also have the case of unitangency only, for convex
  egg-like objects.  I am also not sure what do you mean by
  "symmetrical cases" as two disjoint convex egg-like surfaces will
  only generate bitangencies.

Thats all for now,

Gershon
