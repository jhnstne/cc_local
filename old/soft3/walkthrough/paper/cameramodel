\section{Camera Model}
We need more than just the path of the camera to determine collisions.
The virtual camera is just a point, but the visible volume is a rectangular
frustum defined by certain camera parameters.
These camera parameters are field of view along both the x and y axis ($fovx$
and $fovy$) and the distance from the point camera that define the front and
back of the frustum ($near$ and $far$).
The planes used to make the front and back of the frustum are called the near
and far clipping planes.
The diagram below shows how these four parameters define the visible volume.

When trying to determine collisions, the near clipping plane is what interests
us.
It is like the ``lens'' of the virtual camera.
If any scene geometry collides with the near clipping plane (NCP from now on)
then it is like the lens of the camera is running into that scene geometry.
