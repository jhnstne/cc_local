ViewFrustum -

This figure shows the rectangular frustum that determines what is visible or
not visible.
Notice how the intersection of the near clipping plane with the rectangular
pyramid produces the near quadrilateral.

IntersectionDepth -

A sample near quadrilateral where the upper left, lower right,and upper right
vertices protrude through the scene, illustrated by grey lines.
Each protruding, "bad", vertex takes the max of the intersections closest to it
on each adjacent edge as its approximate depth.
The depth of the intersection is taken as the maximum of these vertex depths.

ParmInterval - 

Red Lines indicate scene geometry that intersects.
Numbers indicate the order in which surface triangles are tested against the 
scene.
In this case, s0 and s1 would be interpolated between to find $t_i$ and s2
and s3 woudl be interpolated between to find $t_f$.

Intersection -
Black lines are corner curves before correction.
Green curves are corner curves after correction.
The black rectangles represent the parameter interval over which the collision
took place.
Notice that after the change is made to correct the collision, the green
and black lines coincide.
