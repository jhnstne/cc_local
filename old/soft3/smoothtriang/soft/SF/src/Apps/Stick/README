This directory contains the sourse for the program 'Stick'.  The main
program is in the file 'toSticks.c'.  

The suggested method of adding new formats is to create two routines, 
one to read your format and put a triangle into the internal triangle format,
and another to write out a triangle in the internal format to whatever format
you desire.  Note that one of these routines might be unnecessary if
you are willing to use a format already in place.

Next, add a new #define constant to identify your format (these constants
are in stick.h).  Now modify the routines InputType() and/or Method() to
enable Stick to use your new format.  Finally, modify the routines
ReadTriangle() and/or PrintTriangle() to call your new routine(s).
