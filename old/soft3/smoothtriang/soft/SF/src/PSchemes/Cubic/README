This scheme is a simple C^0 scheme created to get a feel for how
bad it is to fit a single cubic patch to each triangular facet.
Each cubic interpolates the position and normal at each corner
of the triangle of data.  The boundary curves are constructed
so that neighboring patches share boundary curves.  However,
along these boundaries, the patches only meet C^0.

The steps of the construction are:
	1. Construct boundary curves.
		A variety of possibilities exist here.  One
		simple method is to construct a plane for the
		boundary curve to lie in (take for example, the
		plane defined
