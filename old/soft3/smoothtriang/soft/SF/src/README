There is a dependency between the various software packages
in this directory:
        geometry
            Dstruct
                Mesh
                    lib
Note, however, that the dependency on geometry can be removed
from both Dstruct and Mesh (the Dstruct dependency is in a
utility library, and the Mesh dependency is in the UserData).

There are three Schemes directories:
	FSchemes 	- some functional data fitting schemes
	PSchemes	- some parametetric data fitting schemes
	RSchemes	- some research data fitting schemes
