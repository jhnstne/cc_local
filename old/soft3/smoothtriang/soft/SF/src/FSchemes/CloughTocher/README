Five versions of Clough-Tocher:
    CloughTocher.c	- Standard Clough-Tocher; split after
			  computing crossboundary
    CloughTocherB.c	- Standard Clough-Tocher; split before
			  computing crossboundary (the other
			  version is more efficient).
    Farin.c		- Farin's modification to Clough-Tocher;
			  this version minimizes the C^2
			  discontinuity of the mini-triangles.
    Foley.c		- Use the Foley-Opitz method for computing
			  the crossboundary derivative.
			  This version has cubic percision.
    MFarin.c		- Minimize the C^2 discontinuity across
			  macro-triangles (and then split).
			  This version has cubic percision.
