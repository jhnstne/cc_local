NAME
     AddRemoveMesh - A set of routines for adding and removing
     mesh objects

SYNTAX
     #include mesh.h

DESCRIPTION
     _A_d_d_R_e_m_o_v_e_M_e_s_h are routines designed to simplify the addition
     / removal  of mesh objects. Remove operators free the data
     structures. These routines are meant for use by the routines
     described in the _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r_s (_3) manpages.

ROUTINES
     BOOLEAN AddMeshVertex( m, v )
     Mesh *m;
     Vertex *v;

     Adds a Vertex to the mesh iff the vertex is not on the mesh
     lists already.  Returns TRUE if the vertex was added, FALSE
     if not added.

     BOOLEAN AddMeshEdge( m, e )
     Mesh *m;
     Edge *e;

     Adds an Edge to the mesh iff the edge (and its sym edge) is
     not on the mesh lists already.  Returns TRUE if the edge was
     added, FALSE if not added.

     BOOLEAN AddMeshFace( m, f )
     Mesh *m;
     Face *f;

     Adds a Face to the mesh iff the face is not on the mesh
     lists already.  Returns TRUE if the face was added, FALSE if
     not added.

     BOOLEAN RemoveMeshVertex( m, v )
     Mesh *m;
     Vertex *v;

     Removes a Vertex from the mesh iff the vertex is on the mesh
     lists.  Uses _f_r_e_e() to reclaim storage used by the Vertex.
     Returns TRUE if the vertex was removed, FALSE if not
     removed.

     BOOLEAN RemoveMeshEdge( m, e )
     Mesh *m;
     Edge *e;





                                                                1






addremovemesh(3)



     Removes an Edge from the mesh iff the edge is on the mesh
     lists.  Uses _f_r_e_e() to reclaim storage used by the Edge.
     Returns TRUE if the edge was removed, FALSE if not removed.

     BOOLEAN RemoveMeshFace( m, f )
     Mesh *m;
     Face *f;

     Removes a Face from the mesh iff the face is on the mesh
     lists.  Uses _f_r_e_e() to reclaim storage used by the Face.
     Returns TRUE if the face was removed, FALSE if not removed.
