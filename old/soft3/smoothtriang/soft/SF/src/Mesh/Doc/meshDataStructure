Mesh Data Structure


The mesh data structure is a variant of the winged edge data structure.
There are edges and nodes.  There are two types of node, vertex nodes
and face nodes.  In the node data structure there is a tag field which
denotes the type of the node.

Edges are the primary object.  Each edge is actually composed of two
half edges.  A half edge has pointers to two nodes and two edges,
plus the symetric half edge (if it exists).  One of the two nodes
is the primal node, and can be thought of as a vertex.  The other
node is the face that the half edge neighbors.  Half edges are
oriented around a face in the clockwise direction.

Nodes have only one pointer, which points to a "representive" edge
that neighbors it.

In addition, both nodes and edges have three data fields: an external
field, an internal data field, and a name field.  The external data
field is a pointer to an ascii string that is read in when the mesh
is read from a file, and written out when the mesh is written to a file.
The internal data field is a user defined structure.  It is intended to
be used to store information such as geometry, color, etc.  The name
field is another character string containing the name of the node (edge).

Pictorially, a half-edge looks like:

 
               prev edge                next edge
                   ^          F            ^
                   |          ^            |
                   \          |            /
                    \         |           /
                   =========================>
                                 | sym    \-------->V
                                 v


where the name and data fields are not shown.



Several assumptions are made about the topological structures
we will be dealing with.  First, it is assumed that all faces
are complete.  That is, there will be a complete ring of half-
edges surrounding each vertex.  The second assumption is that
the boundaries will be "nice".  That is, while a vertex may be
on a boundary, the incomplete ring of edges around the vertex
will be connected.

A half-edge is said to be a boundary edge if it has no symmetric
half-edge.  That is, its 'sym' pointer will be NULL.  A vertex
is said to be a boundary vertex if the edges adjacent to it do
not form a complete ring.  A face is said to be a boundary face
if at least one of its neighboring edges is a boundary edge.
Note that a face may be formed of boundary vertices but not be
a boundary face.
