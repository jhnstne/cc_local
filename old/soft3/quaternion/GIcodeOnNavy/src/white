I'm taking a poll of the faculty re white boards in the conference room
(Room 132).   I would like to add two white boards on the wall that
the light switches are on.  I am a big fan of white boards, mostly
because of an allergy to chalk.  
I think that more board space in the conference room could also be 
useful for research seminars.  
And the most immediate selfish reason is that I don't have a classroom
for Computer Graphics II and would like to run it in the Conference Room.

Any thoughts on this issue, pro or con, are welcome.
In particular, would anyone mind this change in decor?
If you are interested in seeing what the white boards would look like,
they are the same as the one in my office (steel border, 4' by 6').
