***************

This is a Delphi version of Ken Shoemake's ArcBall controller. ArcBall is an
intuitive interface for 3D model viewers. It lets you rotate objects using the
mouse, by clicking and dragging on the surface of a "virtual trackball".

From a programmer's point of view, the most obvious way to interactively rotate
a 3D object might be to update a set of Euler angles (pitch, yaw, roll) based on
mouse movements. However, this can lead to a gimbal lock (a typical problem with
Euler angles), so while it is easy to code, it is not very intuitive for your
users. ArcBall doesn't suffer from the gimbal lock problem, and is very
easy to use.

This archive includes ArcBall.pas, which contains the implementation of the
TArcBall class, and a small OpenGL demo to illustrate the use of this class.

The ArcBall code was ported to Delphi by Chris Rorden; the OpenGL demo was
written by Tom Nuydens.
