See Graphics Gems IV for his arcball manipulation of an object, by projecting mouse position onto a sphere.
The sphere is virtual one surrounding the window, centered.
See the trackball implementation in GLUT glh_glut.h file included in Cg code ~/Cg/SDK/DEMOS/OpenGL/inc/glh/
for implementation ideas.
For example, the present point and the previous point define two points on the sphere and the rotation axis
is the cross-product of these two vectors (to move between these two points on the sphere, we would want to
roll the sphere along this cross-product).
