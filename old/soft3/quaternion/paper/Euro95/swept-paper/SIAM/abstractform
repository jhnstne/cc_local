\title{Submitting an Extended Abstract to a SIAM\\
Conference}
 
We present the numerical analysis of a simplified,
one-dimensional version  
of Peskin's immersed boundary method, which has been used to
solve 
the two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the 
presence of immersed boundaries. We consider the heat
equation  
 in a finite domain with a moving source term.  
We denote the solution as $u(x,t)$ and the location of the
source 
 term as $X(t)$.  The source term is a moving delta function  
whose strength is a function of u at the location of the
delta function. 
The p.d.e. is coupled to an ordinary differential equation
whose  
solution gives the location of the source term. 
 The o.d.e. is $X'(t) = u(X(t),t)$, which can be interpreted as 
saying the source term moves at the local velocity.   
The accuracy the numerical method of solution depends on how
the  
delta function is discretized when the delta function is not
at 
a grid point and on how the solution, u, is represented 
 at locations between grid points. We present results showing 
the effect of different choices of spreading the source to
the grid and 
of restricting the solution to the source location. 
The problem we analyze is also similar to the Stefan problem
and 
the immersed-boundary method has features in common with
particle-in-cell 
 methods.

Vector quantization is the mapping of continuous or high resolution 
discrete vectors such as sampled images into relatively low resolution 
finite reproduction sets.  The primary purpose of vector quantization 
is signal compression, the mapping of a signal into an 
efficient digital representation for communication, storage, or 
as an input to digital signal processing. Compression can mean 
faster communication, lower storage requirements, and faster and simpler 
reconstruction or sythesis.  In addition, it can reduce subsequent 
signal processing complexity 
by suitable choices of digital representations, possibly by 
incorporating portions of the signal processing into the 
codebook generation.

A general design goal of compression is to optimally trade off 
bit rate for quality using codes of modest or moderate complexity. 
One approach to this goal is to combine clustering techniques for 
quality and tree-structured methods for low complexity implementation 
with useful code structures. In this survey some of the basic 
vector quantizer design techniques are sketched along with their 
incorporation of other signal processing such as enhancement and 
classification. The ideas will be demonstrated using medical images. 

Given a matrix whose entries contain parameters that vary within
intervals, we wish to determine whether its eigenvalues have negative
real parts for all values of the parameters.  More specifically, we
seek a bound on the interval widths such that stability is guaranteed
for all values of the parameters within those bounds.  Existing
methods for solving this problem are computationally expensive,
requiring $O(n^6)$ time and $O(n^4)$ storage, and the bounds they produce
are fairly conservative.  This talk will present an algorithm that
gives improved bounds and is less expensive computationally $(O(n^4)$
time, $O(n^2)$ storage).  The algorithm is based on solving Lyapunov
equations.

In this talk we will discuss some recent work on a geometric  
formulation of certain constrained variational problems in mechanics. The  
constraints are of the nonholonomic variety and the formulation is  
based on the theory of connections in principal bundles. We show that if the 
constraints satisfy suitable symmetry hypotheses, then there is a family of  
splittings of the Lagrangian phase space that yield reductions. Special 
choices  
of splittings correspond to known mechanical connections, and one can for  
instance, obtain the Lagrangian reduction results of Marsden and Scheurle. 
Thus  
the techniques of reduction apply to the constrained problems as well, 
sometimes  
leading to integrable cases. Again, we note the prior work of Koiller that  
handles linear-in-velocity constraints in this way. We then identify optimal 
control problems that fit nicely into this category of mechanical problems  
and investigate explicit solvability of the optimal control problems. We  
shall also indicate some motivating examples from satellite re-orientation,  
robotic motion planning with constraints, and the technology of vibratory  
motors. 

The relationships between $H_\infty$ robust control,
stochastic risk--sensitive
optimal control and differential game problems  have
attracted considerable interest.
The reason for this interest stems from their importance in obtaining
robust controllers. In this talk we discuss
a finite horizon nonlinear stochastic risk--sensitive
optimal control
problem and show that it is equivalent to a {\it stochastic} differential
game. Risk--sensitivity and  small noise parameters are introduced,
and the limits are analysed  as these parameters
tend to zero.
First order expansions are
presented which show that the risk--sensitive controller consists of a standard
deterministic controller plus terms due to stochastic and game theoretic
methods of controller  design.

A simple rational interpolation
 method is given for estimating a frequency
response matrix. The method is based on a generalization of
the resolvent identity and avoids the potential inaccuracies
introduced by the subtraction of nearly equal values in the
calculation of the difference terms. When coupled with
a pole cancellation method, the resulting interpolation
algorithm is accurate and efficient. Somewhat surprisingly,
the error in this procedure has the form
of a modified response matrix, which means that the interpolation
algorithm can be used to approximate both the response matrix
and the error. Numerical tests show that this approach is
very efficient, especially when coupled with the well-known
Hessenberg preprocessing method.
