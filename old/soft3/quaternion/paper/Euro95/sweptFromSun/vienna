Sorry, the Austrian National Tourist Office no longer has an outlet
serving the walk-in public.   They told me this when I called them up
yesterday to check their address, 500 5th Avenue.
But you can telephone them at 212-944-6880 and ask for the hotel guide
with prices and hotel descriptions for Vienna.
I'll do the same on Monday; then we can "compare notes" as to what area
you'd like to stay in.
Cheers,
Bruce
