Jim,
I've written a paper on swept surfaces that I would like you
to take a look at.
I plan to put your name on the paper, since it builds off our work
on the rational interpolation of orientation.
Please let me know what you would like for me to do about this.
I am sending a dvi file of the present draft of the paper
(uuencoded in the next message)
still unfinished (e.g., no introduction).
I plan to submit it to Eurographics on Friday.
Sorry for the short notice, but I've been pushing 
hard to finish it up, and just now got it all written down.

I have a good implementation of this method and will send
you some pictures (notice that the figures aren't yet
incorporated in the paper either) when they are ready.


Cheers,
John
