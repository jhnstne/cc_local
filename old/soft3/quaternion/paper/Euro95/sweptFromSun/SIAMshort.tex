\title{An exact sweep of a curve}
 
\abstract{We show how to construct a rational Bezier model of a swept
surface that interpolates
$n$ positions and orientations of a fixed rational space curve
and maintains the shape of the curve at all intermediate points
of the sweep.
Thus, the surface models
an exact sweep of the curve, consistent with the given data.
Through a simple extension, we also allow the sweeping curve to change
its size through the sweep.
The position, orientation, and size of the sweeping curve can change with
arbitrary continuity.
This surface
encompasses the surface of revolution and extruded surface, but extends
them to arbitrary sweeps.
It can also be used to model the path of a swept object whose shape does not
change during the sweep, such as in robotics and CAD/CAM, using curves generated
automatically by the moving object.}
