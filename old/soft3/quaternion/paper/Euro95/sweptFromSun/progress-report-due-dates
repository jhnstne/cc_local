I had previously mentioned that the due date for incremental award requests
is two months before the grant anniversary or July 1, whichever comes
earlier.  Pls note that the due date has been now changed to THREE months
before the grant annicversary or JUNE 1, whichever comes earlier.  Also pls
note that the requests for supplements (reu, educational, etc.) should be
received by March 1.

===================================================================
The number of proposals, and level of effort in processing them,
requires that we institute and enforce strict dates for requests for
supplements and continuing awards in 1995.

All requests for supplements MUST be RECEIVED by the appropriate
program officer by March 1, 1995.  Any requests received after that
date will be considered for funding in fiscal 1996.  All reports and
requests relative to continuing awards MUST be RECEIVED by the
appropriate program officer three months prior to the anniversary
date of the award, or June 1, 1995, whichever is earlier.  If any of
the materials are not received by June 1, 1995, action will be
deferred until fiscal 1996.  Please check with your Grants  Office
regarding the material that is needed.  All the requirements appear
in the most recent NSF Grant Proposal Guide (NSF 94-2, see VI. B,
pages 18,19).  Also please note, that an award may not be processed
until all required NSF Forms 98A (National Science Foundation Final
Project Report) from previous grants are received for the PI and any
Co-PI on the project.

We hope these requirements do not place too great a burden on you,
and that receiving this information now will provide you with
adequate time to submit the needed materials.  Should you have any
questions, please refer them to Gerald Engel (gengel@nsf.gov or 703-
306-1910)
