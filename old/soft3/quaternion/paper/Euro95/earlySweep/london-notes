change term for PH curves? to rational-length-tangent curves?

Applications to smooth animation via always-rational-quaternions
(i.e., always-rational rotation matrices) as needed by Wang@Alberta.

We wish to create a Bezier representation for a swept surface
that interpolates this data, and is consistent with the fact
that the sweeping object is always a sphere.
%In particular, we will create a Bezier curve $c(t)$ that interpolates
%the position (center of the sphere), a Bezier function $r(t)$
%that interpolates the size (radius), impose a condition
%that guarantees a sweeping sphere, and create a surface from this data.

DOES JIM HAVE THE IMPLEMENTATION THAT TAKES C-R-O AND CREATES
A BEZIER SURFACE, SO THAT ALL THAT IS LACKING IS THE DEFN OF C
(O IN TERMS OF C, AND R TRIVIALLY)? yes
