Is the directrix curve of a cyclide a Pythagorean-hodograph curve?

Given the Bezier directrix curve d(t) and a Bezier radius function r(t),
we are interested in finding the control net for the offset of d(t) by
r(t).  This will be a column of the tensor product Bezier surface.

DONE:
Given a c(t),o(t),r(t) triple where o(t) is a vector function
of fixed length (e.g., a curve on the unit sphere generated by Dietz-
Hoschek method) which it must be to generate a rational surface,
create this surface parameterization.

Open problem: can we create all rational curves on the sphere using
	Dietz/Hoschek method?

How do you generate *intuitive* spherical curves?
