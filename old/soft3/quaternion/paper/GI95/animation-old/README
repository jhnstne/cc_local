BASIC EXAMPLES
cube: 
pos.in-evenspeed/quaternion.in1 is a very plain example
maple leaf:
pos.in-evenspeed/quaternion.in5 is best overall example (used in GI figures)
pos.in2/quaternion.in2 is another good example
pos.in3/quaternion.in3 is a complicated example

WORKING OF ALGORITHM EXAMPLE 
use pos.in-evenspeed/quaternion.in5: only show left quaternion sphere
	animation
	animation -I	(to show inverse images)
	animation -s -S	(to show interpolation in space)
	animation -S -m	(to show mapping back of curve)

EXAMPLES OF ANOMALIES/PROBLEMS
pos.in?/quaternion.in? (see Script on cerulean) with animation-twisted
	is a good illustration that control polygon lies outside sphere
	spin the picture
pos.in-evenspeed/quaternion.in1 with animation-antipodal (2nd quaternion is
	switched to its antipodal counterpart (-x,-y,-z,-w,1))
	shows the danger of antipodal choices well
TRY non-euclidean metric knot sequencing as in Section 8.1 to control speed as example
example of cusp

FINALE
pos.in-leaf/quaternion.in-leaf is a fun falling leaf: using -A
pos.in-hockey2/quaternion.in-hockey2: hockey slapshot: using -A
