John,

This is the almost complete set of the maple programs I wrote
for this investigation.  I will try to give an overview:

genutils.maple	:	general utilities, norms, homogenization etc
bezutils.maple	:	I chose to represent bezier curves as 1d vectors
			of control points, TP bez surfaces as 2d vectors.
			This code adds, subtracts, multiplies, and 
			differentiates curves as well as doing Tensor products
			of curve pairs
sphere_curves.maple :	definitions of the delta,eta,sigma etc.. functions
			from the DH paper

ho5+.maple, hoshek.maple : on sphere interpolation programs that set up
			the linear system and solve it

interpX.maple	:	wrapper program that will perform a X point interpolation
			on the sphere, and then render the curve

solvecubic, cubic, quintic etc.. : programs directed at solving the PH curve
				restrictions for various degrees

writehull,writecurve :	i/0 programs that write curves and hulls to files
			as piecewise linear segments

numX.maple	:	programs to solve the PH restrictions in purely
			numerical fashion

csplines.maple	:	attempt to solve conditions for C1 continous bezier
			splines that had PH property
