Sorry I have not been in closer touch.  I had a 1 week revision 
turnaround for a paper I have in CVIU this November.  I would like to talk
about an implementation-centric (numerical arc length parameterization
etc) paper and about a possible submission of a rational GC paper to
CVPR on Nov 20.  The one thing I would need to put together a 
vision based paper is a segmented 3D image of thick, non-branching chunk of
artery or bone.  I will ask Russ Taylor if he has a 3-D femur
image sitting around.  I thought you might have something available
from your work with the heart guys.

I believe that given a 3D image of the artery chunk I could do the following
using stuff from my earlier lung vascular research.

	- Produce a control hull for the axis (directrix) curve
	- Produce orientation frames for every point on this 
	control hull
	- Produce cross-section boundary curves with a regular,
	corresponding knot sequence

By emphasizing the CAD integration advantages of the rational model,
I think we could sell this to the vision community.

Jim
