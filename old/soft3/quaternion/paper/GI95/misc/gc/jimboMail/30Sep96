An excellent vision conference is CVPR -- I am working on another project 
for it.  The deadline is on the 20th of November. 

I have also been looking at applications to generalized cylinders.  The primary
application I see is that we can produce a fairly accurate rational representation
for an arbitrary non-rational GC.  All GC's in vision except for those with 
linear axes are irrational.  Usually this irrationality comes from the use 
of triginometric functions in the definition of the GC.

In Boult's paper, he cites problems associated with using the frenet-serret frame
to define curved axis generalized cylinders.  Specifically mentioned were singularities
in the representation that caused the FS frame to disappear entirely.  

To remedy these problems, he proposes using a semi-fixed frame of reference involving
a frame generated by crossing the tangent vector with a constant vector.

His representation results in a fairly hairy function.  I think that by using rational
representations, it would be easier to extract 1'st and 2'nd order properties, namely
the principal directions and curvatures of the surface.  Such extracted models could
also be easily incorporated into CAD systems.
