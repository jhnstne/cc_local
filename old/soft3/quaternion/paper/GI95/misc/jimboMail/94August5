This is what we have to work with:


For canal surfaces -- those surfaces for which we wish to sweep a 
circular cross section -- we can specify the path as an arbitrary
Bezier curve and then create a Dietz-Hoschek curve that will serve
as the pseudo-derivative of the path.  The handwritten sheet of
calculations that I gave you allows me to extract an otrhonormal
system from a DH curve.

Extension of this to splines:

Section 4, page 227 of the DH paper gives an extension of the technique
for generating Bezier curves on the sphere to B-Splines on the sphere.
Since DH treats this fairly abstractly, I would probably want to do the
same in a writeup, concentrating on the case of a single Bezier curve.

Non-Circular cross sections:

Oriented systems require us to create curves on the 4-sphere.  This
extends things to pythagorean quintuples (a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=e^2) and 
we have the following sufficient condition detailing the restrictions
on the coefficients of a-e:

We will use 4 "generating polynomials" of degree K named p,q,r,s.

a = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 -s^2
b = 2*p*s
c = 2*q*s
d = 2*r*s
e = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2

We must find a general symbolic solution to this system in order for this
to be useful AND prove that this solution is always real.

QUATERNION to MATRIX and back

Conversion from quaternions to matrices require only additions and multiplications.
The curves on the 4 sphere are quaternion curves.  Conversion to matrix curves
is given in (Shoemake, SIGGRAPH '85 p 253)

Conversion from matrix to Quaternion involves irrational operations, but this
is ok, since such conversions would take place prior to constructing the
curve on the 4-sphere.
