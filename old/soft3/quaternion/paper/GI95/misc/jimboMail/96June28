Angular velocity is a good candidate.
I seem to recall that this is one of the few criteria emphasized
in the ME literature, e.g., in spacecraft control, when talking about
orientation control.  I'll look this up again.
And spreading the angular velocity over the entire path sounds optimal.
Note that this is equivalent to zero acceleration, which relates
to the optimization in Barr et. al.'s animation paper
(they minimize tangential acceleration).

I'll have to think more about whether I believe that the derivative
of the rotation matrix is exactly angular velocity, but it sounds right.

In other words, full speed ahead.

This sort of argument is the key.
Let me know any breakthroughs.

I have been working on the first challenge (the coverage of quaternion curves
by our map) and the writeup.
