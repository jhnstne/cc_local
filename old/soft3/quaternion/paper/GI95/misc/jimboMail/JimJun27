John,

	I have been doing some thinking about the following question that 
	you raised:

	The physical property that I have been looking at is angular 
	velocity.  

	Suppose we have a parameterized rotation matrix M(t). The position function
	for a given point p being rotated according to M(t) is:

	M(t)p

	If we want the instantaneous velocity vector of this point, we need to
	evaluate the expression:
	
	M'(t)p 

 	Please verify, but t occurs to me that M' is the Jacobian of a parameterized
	rotation.  

	It is my hypothesis that if we arc-length parameterize the curve on the quaternion
	sphere (ignoring for the moment that this cannot be done in a rational manner), then
	the determinant of the Jacobian, det(M'(t)) should be 1.  

	Constant angular velocity for all points should result in constant kinetic
	energy for the object over the duration of it's rotation.  Ek = SUM(1/2 MV^2)
	setting V constant results in constant Ek -- this is a conservation of energy 
	argument.

	The way I have been trying to go about this mathematically is to look at the
	position function in the quaternion world QipQ and show that if Q' is a unit
	quaternion then d/dt(QipQ) is constant.

	Tell me if you think this makes sense.

Jim
