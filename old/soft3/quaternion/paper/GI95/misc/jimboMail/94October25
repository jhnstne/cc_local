I was thinking that something should be mentioned
about how Minverse really maps unit quaternions to 
lines.

When we take Minv(1,q1,q2,q3,q4) we could just
as well use the projectively equivalent point
Minv(k,kq1,kq2,kq3,kq4) because 

M(Minv(q)) =proj= M(Minv(kq))

where =proj= is equivalence under homogenization

Which means we could choose any point along a line
in projective 4-space, and it will yield the same 
ultimate curve even though

Minv(q) != Minv(kq)

It makes life a lot simpler to choose k=1 as we have
done, but I think this should be explicit in the
treatment on page 7 and should be noted in the end
of section 2 : Realted Work where you state that a
difference between us and Dietz is the linear system.
In fact we are just making life easier by choosing
given points on a projecting line, where Dietz just
works the whole projecting line. I think it may also
be good to toss this into "future directions"
