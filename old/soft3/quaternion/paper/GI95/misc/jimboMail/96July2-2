The motivation behind showing this for a general unit quaternion curve
was that it is not difficult to discretely calculate the arc-length 
function of our curves using a standard numerical integration technique.
The fact that the arc length function is positive and monotonically 
increasing makes numerical integration an efficient approach -- simple
trapezoid method based techniques would do the job (as opposed to more
complex things like romberg integration etc..).

Using these well known and easy to implement techniques, it is possible
to create a series of t-values {t1....tk} which represent keyframes of
the animation spaced at intervals of equal arc length.

It would be nicer to find a closed form for the arc length function, but
I am not optimistic about this prospect.

This would be a good result, but there is one thing that confuses me,
M(K1*Minverse(P)) = M(K2*Minverse(P)) for all K1,K2 -- this
projective equivalence mean that Minverse is non-unique.  Does this
matter to your proof?

I will look up that book! Good luck on the proof, I will look further
at physical properties.
