With respect to using PH orientation curves, the sufficient conditions
that Farouki chose for his paper are much easier to solve than the 
nesc. and sufficient conditions given by Dietz, and Farouki is fully 
aware of the Dietz conditions.  I think he chose to use the easier set
because of the extreme messiness involved with solving the full one.  
I think what I did on the full conditions adds little to Farouki's work
besides complication.

I will package up those Maple files and send them to you.  I have 
begun to use a package called Geomview almost exclusively for all of my
visualization now.  I highly recommend it, as it will render anything 
we need and has simple file formats.  I can give you the ftp site
if you are interested.  Geomview is targeted at SGI's so it takes
full advantage of the graphics capabilities.
