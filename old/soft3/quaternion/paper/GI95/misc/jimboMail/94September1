A neat result about cusps:

Let us consider the mapping M to be the composition of
two mappings.

M1: [p,q,r,s] -> [p^2 + q^2 + r^2 -s^2 , 2ps,2qs,2rs]

and

M2: V -> V/||V|| -- normalization


We would like to see if M1 introduces any new cusps.  Let us
assume that [p,q,r,s] has no cusps:

M1[p,q,r,s] has a cusp iff d/dt(M1[p,q,r,s]) = [0,0,0,0]

d/dt(M1[p,q,r,s]) = 	[	2pp' + 2qq' + 2rr'  - 2ss',
				2p's + 2ps',
				2q's + 2qs',
				2r's + 2rs'	]

d/dt(M1[p,q,r,s]) = [0,0,0,0] implies

	p' = -p(s'/s)
	q' = -q(s'/s)
	r' = -r(s'/s)

substituting into {2pp' + 2qq' + 2rr'  - 2ss'} we get :

	-2p^2(s'/s)-2q^2(s'/s)-2r^2(s'/s) -2s's = 0

multiply through by -(s/s')/2 to yield :

	p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 = 0


THEREFORE : M1 introduces a cusp IFF [p,q,r,s] passes through [0,0,0,0]
