Jim, here's the derivation of the inverse formula
for your records.
If X=(x0,x1,x2,x3,x4) = M(p,q,r,s)
then p = x2/2s, q = x3/2s, r = x4/2s and
substituting into x1 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - s^2 yields
4s^4 + (4x1)s^2 - (x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2) = 0
exactly as in your derivation.
Instead of solving the latter, we examine
x0=p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2, which after substitution yields
4s^4 - (4x0)s^2 + (x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2) = 0.
Adding this equation with the previous equation (4 lines up)
yields 4s^2 (2s^2 + x1 - x0) = 0 
yields s=0 or s = +- \sqrt{(x0-x1)/2}.
Substituting this s into the equations for p,q,r,s yields
the inverse map described earlier:
M^{-1}(x0,x1,x2,x3,x4) = (+-2 \sqrt{(x0-x1)/2},x2,x3,x4,x0-x1).

If you can, please code this map up in your graphics package
(that is, code up the map M and its inverse M^{-1})
and apply it mathematically and pictorially to verify that
I haven't made any mistakes.  


For step 2 (finding a curve to interpolate the inverse images
{r1,...,rk}) we can apply typical interpolation techniques:
since M^{-1} yields points, not entire lines, we don't need
the system of linear equations solution of Dietz-Hoschek.

A good place for you to work on is step 3:
finding control points of the image of the space curve found
in step 2 (using product formulas for Bernstein polynomials),

I want to get some pictures of this technique in action
(i.e., some pictures of curves on the 4sphere interpolating
given points) to verify that we are making sense before
we send off any abstract (even the 1page version) to a
conference.  Since the abstract is due at the end of the month,
let's try to work out the math as much as possible this week
so that we have some spare time for the implementation.
