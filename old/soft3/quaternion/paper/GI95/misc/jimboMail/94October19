Jim,
I'm at the cusp part of the paper:
when the map M introduces cusps (and hopefully ways of easily
avoiding these cusps by appropriate design of the curve in 4-space
before mapping by M).
You rightly observe that any point on the space curve c(t)
where c(t) = c'(t) will cause a cusp at M(c(t)).
However, this is simply one of the type of points that leads
to cusps.  (You also mention the image of (0,0,0,0) is a cusp.)
In particular, when I type the following into Maple
(where c(t) = (p,q,r,s), c'(t) = (P,Q,R,S))

a := p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2;
A := 2*p*P + 2*q*Q + 2*r*R + 2*s*S;
eqns := {a*(p*S + P*s) - A*p*s,
         a*(q*S + Q*s) - A*q*s,
         a*(r*S + R*s) - A*r*s};
solve(eqns,{p,q,r,s});

you will see that there are a lot of other solutions.
Some can be immediately discarded because they are imaginary,
but others are less clear (the ROOTOF solutions, in particular).

I bring this up because I think we need a parallel attack on this
problem.  Think about it and let me know if you have any insights.
I am looking for an elegant characterization of the points of
c(t) that map to cusps, and hopefully a characterization that makes
it clear how to avoid these types of points (e.g., it is easy to
avoid the origin).

John
