I don't have Maple, but I have an Indy and an Indigo2 Extreme.
You're right about the visualization of the curves on the
4-sphere, but I guess what I mean is that we need to doublecheck
that our curves are truly on the unit sphere, via Maple I suppose,
and get some feel for the `naturalness' of the generated curves (I'm not sure how to do that right now,
short of generating animations of a spinning object
using the quaternions generated by the curve).

Let's concentrate on completing steps 2 and 3 to get a 
basic version of the algorithm finished before you look
at continuity and cusps.

We'll have to think up a natural example to test this
on and to motivate the algorithm in the paper, but that
can also wait a bit.
