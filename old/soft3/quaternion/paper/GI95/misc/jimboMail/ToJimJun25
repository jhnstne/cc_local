Jim, here's what I'm thinking about right now re the quaternion curve papers.

1) There are three distinct subjects to cover: rational orientation curves,
	animation using same, swept surfaces using same.
	At the moment, I am thinking of these as three independent papers,
	although it remains to be seen whether they will end up that way
	(e.g., animation and sweeping may need to be combined to yield
	a meaningful paper on applications)
	It is useful to keep these 3 subjects orthogonal in our minds
	regardless of what we end up doing.

2) Each of the three subjects has one issue that I'd like to resolve:

  a) Quaternion curves: Can we achieve a result analogous to Dietz et. al.
	on coverage of curves as opposed to points?
	That is, we know that the map M is surjective.
	Is it `surjective' with respect to curves too?
	Dietz's map onto the 2-sphere has this property (see that paper).
	This result was a clincher for Dietz that they had chosen the
	correct map.
	Since we essentially pulled M out of a hat (the only map
	we could find that satisfied the properties) it would be nice
	to establish that it is the correct map in the above way.

  b) Animation:	Can we add some physical motivation (as opposed to purely
	geometric) to the animations generated by using our quaternion curves,
	as in Barr?  Russ Taylor asked a question along these lines after
	my talk at Hopkins.  There are two approaches:
	i) show that the present method has some physical properties
			           (hopefully physical optimizations)
	or (ii) change the map slightly to achieve a given physical property.

  c) Swept surfaces: Can we reduce the degree?
	At present, we yield a degree (12,n) surface.
	Perhaps (but I don't think so) by staying in quaternion world
	rather than translating to rotation matrices.
	Staying in quaternions would be interesting exercise anyway.

	The difficulty with degree reduction in the context of this paper
	is that we want an exact rep
	and so we would need to show that the surface we create
	is inherently a surface of lower degree, not just approximable by one.

John
