I can't say too much for elegance, but here is another
way of looking at the problem:

	| s 0 0 p | | p' |   	
	| 0 s 0 q | | q' |       
	| 0 0 s r | | r' |    =   | 0 0 0 0 |
	| p q r s | | s' |

What can we say about this system of first order ODE's?
I am woefully deficient in ODE-system solving knowlege.

What is nifty is that if s=s'=0, then we get the geometric
condition <V,V'> != 0.

Also consider, in order for this system to have a non-trivial
solution, the matrix on the lhs must have det = 0, or more simply,
the rows may NOT be linearly independent.
