This was the gist of the mail. We are actually making
a simplifying assumption in choosing the projective 
point  (1,q) for the quaternion q

Note that:

Minv(1,q) != Minv(k,kq)

but Minv(k*(1,q)) = sqrt(k)*Minv(1,q)
and
M(kx) = k^2*M(x) so

M(Minv(k*(1,q))) = M(sqrt(k)*Minv(1,q)) = k^2 * M(Minv(1,q))

so, for every qi we interpolate we actually have a choice
of any k*(1,qi), so we are just choosing k=1 to simplify it
to an interpolation problem, otherwise it would be a line 
interpolation problem and more similar to Dietz et al.
