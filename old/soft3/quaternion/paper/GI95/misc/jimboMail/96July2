That's a good proof that arc-length parameterized quaternion curves
yield constant velocity of the actual object.
Another way to see this is that the metrics of the quaternion sphere
and rotation matrices are equivalent, so a constant speed along the
quaternion sphere (arc-length param) yields a constant speed of rotation.

I am particularly interested in proving some properties of *our M map*
related to velocity or tangential acceleration,
and thus properties of our quaternion curve rather than general quaternion
curves.
While you're in the groove, why don't you think about this issue?

I am tantalizingly close to establishing that our M map is related to
the nec and suff condition for Pythagorean quintuples in the same way
that Dietz et. al.'s map is for Pyth quadruples
(and thus that M is onto all rational quaternion curves).

P.S. I have found a useful book re quaternions: `Numbers' by
H.D. Ebbinghaus et. al. (Springer 1990).
For example, it has a statement of the length-preserving rule you prove
(|q1q2| = |q1| |q2|).
