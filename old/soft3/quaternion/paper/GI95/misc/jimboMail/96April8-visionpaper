John,

My schedule starts opening up in early May.  I am going to Cambridge
for ECCV this Thursday and returning on the 21'st. I am also considering
putting together another application of the same quaternion math targeted
for the Vision community that we could submit to CVPR.

What do you think of Graphical Models & Image Processing as a poosible
venue for the quaternion paper?

Jim
