John,  

This is a list of edits I came up with, tell me what you think:

EDIT #	PAGE	

1	3	"...which leads to a system of equations approach..."
		I believe ours could just as easily be a system of
		equations based on the mail I sent you about Minv.

2	5	"We want a rational map from 4-space...."
		Perhaps we should define rational map explicitly

3	5	"Step 1 is well understood.."
		Point out that there are two choices for each quaternion?

4	5	The result is from number theory, should we point out
		the work done by Dietz in transferring Lebes. formula
		to the polynomial ring and mention that our formula also
		transfers to the polynomial ring in the same way.

5	6	"We are not as lucky in 4-space..."
		We are not as fortunate with M as it constitutes a
		sufficient but not necessary condition for forming a
		pythagorean quintuple (quadruple?).

6	7	Why do we choose positive sqrt?  How can we justify this.


7	7	some properties of M and Minv we might mention:
			Minv(kq) = sqrt(k)Minv(q)
			M(kx) = k^2*M(x)
			M(Minv(kq)) = M(sqrt(k)Minv(q)) = kM(Minv(q))

8	8	"...(compare () and ()." 
		Is there a paren missing here?

9	9	I did not see a close bracket "]" in the first equation

10	10	Section 8.2 is a little unclear to me.  "If a curve segment
		is k times longer..."  longer than?  I think that a figure
		might help here, showing subdivision and measuring segments.

11	11	"...defined below and k=CC'/CC."
		This should actually be CC/CC' because k is on the opposite
		side as it is in the proof on page 12 (I think)

12	11	when you say C(t) is a cusp, maybe it should be a 
		definite t like t sub 0 or something to distinguish it 
		from the general "t"

13	12	I think that this is an optimal place to include a table
		something like:
		
		-------------------------------------------------
		S	|	=0		|	!=0
		--------------------------------------------------
		S'	|			|
			-----------------------------------------
		=  0	|			|
			-----------------------------------------
		!= 0	|			|
		-------------------------------------------------

		and fill in the boxes with the relevant conditions.

14	12	"Multiplying by ||C(t)||^2"  
		this should be cubed I believe

15	12	The eqn: ||C||^2C' - (C dot C')C = 0
		is a vector equation so it should be = (0,0,0,0)

16	12	General comment:  why use two different representations
		for || C(t) ||, the radical may make it more confusing
		to read



17	14	BIBLIO -- is Pletinckx the actual spelling?

18	14	BIBLIO -- should "PH Space Curves" be included?
