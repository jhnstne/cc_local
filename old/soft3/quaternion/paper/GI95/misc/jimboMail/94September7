John,


	I have been thinking about some sort of example that would
	illustrate advantages of the quaternion sphere inverse mapping
	and it seems to me that animation is not the way to go.  It
	would not serve as a static illustration in a paper and would
	probably not look as good as animations produced by people who
	specialize in it.

	It would probably be best to produce a swept surface of a sort
	that would be difficult to produce with existing techniques.

	Also, I wanted to find out what the submission guidelines are
	for CAGD.  Would this be a good place to submit this work?

Jim
