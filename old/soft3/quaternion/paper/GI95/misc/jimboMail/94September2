A second, and hopefully final result on cusps:

In the previous message, I showed that if we split
the mapping into two parts, M1 & M2, it was easy to
show that M1 introduced cusps only if the source
curve passed through the origin.  Here is another
take on cusps:


Let's look at the whole mapping:

	Let A = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2

	M: [p,q,r,s] -> [(p^2+q^2+r^2-s^2)/A,(2ps)/A,(2qs)/A,(2rs)/A]

	d/dt(A) = A' = 2pp' + 2qq' + 2rr' + 2ss'

	d/dt(M([p,q,r,s]))=[ 	A(2pp'+2qq'+2rr'-2ss') - A'(p^2+q^2+r^2-s^2)
			     	-------------------------------------------  ,
				 		A^2
				(A(ps'+p's) - A'(ps))/A^2,
				(A(qs'+q's) - A'(qs))/A^2,
				(A(rs'+p's) - A'(rs))/A^2	]

	d/dt(M([p,q,r,s]))=[0,0,0,0] implies

				(A(ps'+p's) - A'(ps))/A^2 = 0
				(A(qs'+q's) - A'(qs))/A^2 = 0 
				(A(rs'+r's) - A'(rs))/A^2 = 0 

	Solving these expressions for p',q',r' respectively and back substituting
	into the first component of the derivitive vector causes the first 
	component to go to zero.  So we can concentrate on these three similar
	expressions.

	It is obvious from inspection that if s=s'=0 these expressions will go to zero.
	
	We assume that A', [p',q',r',s'] <> [0,0,0,0], so this condition does not apply.
	We also assume that A<>0 because earlier I determined that this will cause a
	cusp.

	Now note, if [p,q,r,s] = [p',q',r',s'] then all terms go to zero.

Jim
