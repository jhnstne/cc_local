I think it might be a good idea of we put together a 
production timetable for a journal article version of
the swept surfaces work.  Should I be checking the review boards
on some of the graphics journals?

	Excellent idea.
        A reasonable timetable seems to be:  
        July 1: full sketch of what results we are going to
                include in this paper (i.e., pure animation
                or animation plus sweeping or...), including
                section titles
                + 
                full literature search done 
                + 
                completion of any extra results (e.g., independent
                of coordinate system, ...)

        August 1: complete draft of paper

        August 15 (modulo SIGGRAPH): submit

There is probably some added software that needs to be written,
which should be added to the August 1 list.    

Potential journals seem to be:
        IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
        IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
        spinoff of CVGIP (the graphics half)

We can refine that list based on editorial boards and recent journal content.

I'm off to Europe tomorrow, but I'm free come June.  

John

P.S.  I also like your previous idea of a spinoff of this work
	to vision problem.  We can talk about that as we refine this one.
