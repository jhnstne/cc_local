Definitions:

let F(t) = [w,A,B,C,D] -- our projective curve
let f(t) = [A,B,C,D]   -- F(t) minus homog. coordinate
let S(t) = [A/w,B/w,C/w,D/w] -- homogenized 4-sphere curve

{A,B,C,D,w are all parametric in t}

---------------------------------------

As to cusps on our 4-sphere curves, S(t).  When we divide through
by the homogeneous parameter w = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2 we are
compressing all lines through the origin to opposed pairs of points
on the 4-sphere.


If the tangent vector of f(t) -- f'(t) at t=ti is parallel to the 
projecting line l(s) = s * f(ti) we can have a cusp.  More formally

IF [f'(ti) / ||f'(ti)||] = +/- [f(ti) / ||f(ti)||] then a cusp may exist


do you concur?



Also, I am sending you the Maple programs to do this interpolation 
polynomially, this program still uses power basis polynomial interpolation,
but it does work.   I know you do not have Maple, but this program is
text-only, so you can experiment with it via rlogin if you want.
