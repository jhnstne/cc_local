She's on the way to you via fax.

	That's definitely the next step.

	The only good raw images are of brain, although
	we have plenty of contour data of nonbranching structure.
	I assume that's not what you want.

Some comments on the faxed paper.
First, the perfect place for this type of paper is CAGD,
because this is the best forum for papers about curves.
This is the more foundational paper, appropriate for CAGD,
and we can shoot for a more applied journal like IEEE CG+A
in the next applications paper.
I'm shooting to send it off on Monday, so please get me your comments
before then.

In answer to your questions about theorem 6.2:

1.  Should you consider stating that for every member x
            of R(t) it is possible to factor x into a square
            component and a square-free component?

	Done.

2. In the first example you annotate the last step
            with the comment "using X1^2+.....+Xn-1^2 = Xn^2."
            I don't see where you actually need to use this property
            to make the transformation.  It seems to me to just
            be a direct substitution based on the definition
            gh^2 = xn - x1.

	We need this formula for simplification of the numerator.

Note the new restriction of the inverse of M in Lemma 7.1 to x5>0.
This is necessary to avoid negative square roots.
Also the change of `line' to `ray' in Corollary 7.1.

You had an earlier question whether restricting to a point on the image line
affects the completeness result.
This is a good question, but no.
By collapsing lines to points in the image space,
we have not affected the completeness result: since every point on a line
of Corollary 7.1 maps to the same point on S^3,
choosing one specific point on the line is immaterial to the final curve
on S^3.

The other changes are scattered throughout the paper and can be best
understood just by reading.

I have a paper to get ready for a special issue in the near term,
but I will be returning to start writing the implementation paper and thinking
about the vision paper soon.

Cheers,
John
