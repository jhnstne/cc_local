EDIT	PAGE

1	8		FOOTNOTE 5: "is the line through (...) in ..."
			Is this "the line through (...) and the origin"
			or is it implicit by the fact k=0 implies origin

2	15		The caption for figure 1 appears in the middle
			of the bibliography in my printout.


P.S.  I was thinking about those extra degrees of freedom, and I think
they might be better employed to improve some quality of the curve like
"closeness of this curve to an arc-length parameterization".
