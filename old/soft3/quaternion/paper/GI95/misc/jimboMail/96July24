John,

I will be in Atlanta until next Thursday to watch some of the
Olympics.  When I get back, I would like to go over that proof
you completed and discuss some of the animation aspects and an
application that may be useful in vision.  Let me know
how your schedule looks in the coming weeks.

I will cheer for some Canadians on your behalf.

Jim
