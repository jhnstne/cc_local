Question: Have you considered using the mapping
M[p,q,r,s] = [p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2, p^2+q^2+r^2-s^2, 2ps, 2qs, 2rs]
instead of your M?  This maps a point from affine 4-space
(normal 4-space) to projective 4-space, and sends any point
onto the unit 4-sphere.  This seems more natural and obviates
the need for step 4, but perhaps you have found your M easier
to deal with.   Note that since there are only 4 fns p,q,r,s
we cannot map from projective 4-space (which would require
five functions) to projective 4-space; Dietz-Hoschek, in
contrast, can map from proj 3-space to proj 3-space in their
DELTA map since the number of functions works out correctly.

Comments?
