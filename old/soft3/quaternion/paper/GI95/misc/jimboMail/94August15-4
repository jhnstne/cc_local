I will read your mail and check the development ASAP.
I'm glad that you're thinking about this aspect of the
problem because after looking everything over today
I concluded that the most intneresting problem is
`rational quaternion curves' (i.e., rational interpolating
curves on the 4-sphere, interpreted as the quaternion sphere)
because of the applications to animation and sweeping both.
Thus, duplication of Dietz-Hoschek for the new (Aida)
sufficient condition is the best track, just as you
have been doing!  I'll be in touch.
