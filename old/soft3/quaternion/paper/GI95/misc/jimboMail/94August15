Jim,  

Arrived safely and are settled in at home and office, so I can
turn back to research.
In your message, you say that:

	`For canal surfaces, we can specify the path as an arbitrary
	Bezier curve and then create a Dietz-Hoschek curve that will
	serve as the pseudo-derivative of the path.'

Can you elaborate on the exact (formal) meaning of this statement?
(path = orientation curve on sphere, not the directrix of the sweep?
pseudo-derivative = ?)

Also, can you motivate this approximation for practical use?

Would the resulting curve have to undergo the integration process,
(of x' to x) or the Dietz-Hoschek inverse-image process (inverse
image of point is line, which are interpolated rather than points)?

In other words, can you give me a full page of overview on this
strategy (without math at this point), ignoring the extensions
to splines or 4-sphere for the moment.

The system here is going to be flaky for the next couple of weeks,
because they are taking down machines to install a new operating
system.  I hope to remain in contact, but I may have to revert
to phoning cogito.cs.jhu.edu, so please cc any correspondence to
my Hopkins jj account too.

John
