For your records:

A cubic Bezier curve in 4-space, with control points b_i,
maps under the map M = (p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2,p^2+q^2+r^2-s^2,2ps,2qs,2rs)
to a Bezier curve of degree 6 on the unit 4-sphere.
My calculations show that the kth control pt of this deg 6 Bezier curve is:

	c_k = \sum_{i,j \geq 0, i+j=k} 
		(\choose{3}{i} \choose{3}{j}) / \choose{6}{k}
		(b_ip b_jp + b_iq b_jq + b_ir b_jr + b_is b_js,
		 b_ip b_jp + b_iq b_jq + b_ir b_jr - b_is b_js,
		 2b_ip b_js,
		 2b_iq b_js,
		 2b_ir b_js)

where \choose{a}{b} is "a choose b" and \geq is 'greater than or equal to'.
Notice the similarity to the M map, except for the leading `choose' term
and the summation over all i,j summing to k.

No matter what interpolation technique we use to create the original 
curve in 4-space, we should ensure that it is cubic B-spline/Bezier
so that it can be decomposed into the above segments.

It would be good for us to soon investigate the characteristics of 
the class of spherical
curves that the map M creates, since it is not all spherical curves
(that is, given k points on the 4-sphere, we are looking
at some subclass of all curves that interpolate these points while
remaining on the sphere: the class arising from the image under M of 
space curves).
Your suggestion of looking at the continuity of the `M-class of spherical
curves' that you mentioned in a recent mail is one tack at this.
