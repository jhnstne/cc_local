This is where we seem to be at so far:

We have a well defined, simple method of constructing rational curves
on the 4-sphere.  This is not entirely a new thing. Earlier, you gave
me a chapter of a thesis titled "Chapter 4: Interpolation on Quadric
Surfaces by Rational Quadratic Spline Curves" in which the 4-sphere
problem and Shoemake are cited, but the technique is complex, and somewhat
limited and unapproachable.

Our advantage is that any interpolation/approximation method can be 
plugged into our inverse mapping technique.  Here are some applications:

I.	Q : I have a curve for which I know the differential geometry.
	I would like to sweep an oriented cross-section along this
	curve that follows the orientation of the moving trihedral.

	A : 	Derive non-rational expressions for the euler angles of
	the moving trihedral with respect to the base frame, t=0.  
	
		Use Shoemake's euler -> quaternion mapping to create a 
	non-rational quaternion curve Q.  

		Apply Minverse to Q to get a non-rational 
	4-space curve --  Qinverse.  

		Approximate Qinverse with a rational
	curve Qinverse_approx.  There is much work in the literature
	devoted to approximating a non-rational curve with a BSpline,
	any technique will work.  We need not develop our own method 
	or even specify what we would recommend.

		Apply M to Qinverse_approx yielding a unit quaternion
	curve Qapprox.

		Construct a parametric rotation matrix using Qapprox.

		Generate the surface.


II.	Q: I  have a planar hole H1 in surface A, and a planar
		 hole H2 in surface B.  
	H1 is described by the function F1 and the orientation O1, likewise
	H2 is described by F2 and O2.  I want to create a closed surface
	to join A and B at H1 and H2. Assume that F1 and F2 are Bezier curves
	or Bsplines.


	A :  First, connect the centers of H1 and H2 with a spine curve S.
		Assume the user will specify this spine curve S. 
	What we have is and inital cross section & orientation [F1,01]
		and a final [F2,O2].  It would be nice if we could use
		the diff. geom. of S to guide our construction of the blend.
		We would want to twist the cross section at about the same
		rate as the trihedral of S.  The problem is that the 
		Osculating plane may not match what we want it to be 
		when the curve intersects H2.  We need to apply some twist
		T to force the match.
	Follow the method in I, but instead of using just the trihedral,
		use a corrected trihedral derived by applying a percentage
		of the twist T to the true trihedral.  The percentage of
		T applied should be based on the arc length of the curve
		traversed.  Interpolation between F1 and F2 should also be
		linear interpolation based on arc length traversed.


These were given to illustrate some possible surface-oriented problems.


What we should create:

	We should be able to specify a curve of infinite precision, but
	unknown representation that lies on the quaternion sphere and
	be able to generate a rational approximation to it based on some
	desired precision.

	We should also be able to specify a number of points on the
	quaternion sphere and generate a rational interpolate for them.



Any thoughts?

Jim
