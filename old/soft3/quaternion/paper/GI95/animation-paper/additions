The observant reader may have noticed that the image of the origin
under M is undefined (and is the only such point).
This is not a problem since we will see that the inverse images 
$M^{-1}$ of unit quaternions all lie above the plane $x_4=0$
(with the sole exception of the identity quaternion $(1,0,0,0,1)$,
which will map onto this plane but far from the origin)
and the entire space curve interpolating the $M^{-1}(q)$ avoids the
origin.
% Moreover, it is easy to jump over a single undefined image, even if
% the space curve passed through it!  That is, use the limit of the two
% neighbouring points.

We arbitrarily choose $M^{-1}(1,0,0,0,1) = (1,1,1,0,1)$ in our implementation.
