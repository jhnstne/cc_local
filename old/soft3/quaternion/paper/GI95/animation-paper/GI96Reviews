>   Orientation can be expressed in 1-1 correspondance with the points on
>   the unit sphere of quaternions.  Given n orientations (e.g. for a camera
>   in an animation sequence), these can be viewed as n points on the unit
>   quaternion sphere, and a smooth animation hitting these n orientations
>   presents the problem of finding a smooth, parametric curve on the unit
>   quaternion sphere.  This paper finds such a curve as a rational Bezier
>   curve.  The advantage of considering rational curves is presented as being
>   the fact that one can map the n sphere points into homogeneous space,
>   interpolate without any normalization constraint on the curve (much
>   simpler than previous interpolation methods), and then project the resulting
>   curve back to the sphere (i.e. rationalize it by dividing by the homogeneous
>   coordinate).  Evidence is presented that the resulting curve on the sphere
>   yields good orientation motion.
