\opening{Dear Editor:}

I enclose the camera-ready copy of the paper 
`Rational control of orientation for animation' 
by John K. Johnstone and James P. Williams,
for publication in Graphics Interface '95.
I also enclose a photocopy and the signed release form.

Please note that I wish to include one colour page.
I have enclosed three photographic slides for this page.
There are three figures on the last page that are
associated with these three pictures.
I have marked the name of the figure on the top of each slide.
Looking at the slide with the figure number at the top
yields the correct orientation of the picture.
(The sphere is always at the left.)

Please consider all slides for the front and back cover of the
proceedings.  For this purpose, I have also included a blownup
version of the maple leaf animation at the right of Figure 2.
This is on a slide marked `Not a figure'.

Please do not hesitate to call me at (205) 934-2213,
fax at (205) 934-5473 or
email me at johnstone@cis.uab.edu if you have any questions.

	
\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
