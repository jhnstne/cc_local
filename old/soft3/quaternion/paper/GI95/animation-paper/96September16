John,

I'm back at my mail now.  I wanted to ask a question about section
6.  I worked through the symbolics while I was away and it seems 
sound.  One small point that I did not get:

In the proof of theorem 6.2:

	1.  Should you consider stating that for every member x
	    of R(t) it is possible to factor x into a square 
	    component and a square-free component?

	2.  In the first example you annotate the last step
	    with the comment "using X1^2+.....+Xn-1^2 = Xn^2."
	    I don't see where you actually need to use this property
	    to make the transformation.  It seems to me to just
	    be a direct substitution based on the definition
	    gh^2 = xn - x1.

Jim

P.S.  Did you receive the copy of the Boult paper that I mailed you?
