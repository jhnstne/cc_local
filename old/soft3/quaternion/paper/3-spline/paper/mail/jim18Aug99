Hi John,


How was SIGGRAPH? I went over the paper a couple of more times. The only
thing
that seems strange to me is why the nearest neighbor selection method for
the inverse
image of the points should produce such dramatically better covariant
acceleration
numbers. Do you have any intuition here? 

One small point -- in the text following definition 4.6, it might be good to
mention that
[Johnstone 99b] explains the title "most natural."

Another thing that I have been meaning to ask you about -- could you take a
look at 
CH4 Appendix 4.A of my thesis. if you dont have a copy, the .ps is on my JHU
web page.
I wonder if this section actually invalidates most of the reasons for
building rational curves
on S^3. I didn't want to emphasize this before my defense ;).

On another note. I think there are at most 384 unique quadratic maps from R4
to S3 or subsets of
S3. This gets back to the issue of quadratic forms which is something I wish
I 
understood better.

Otherwise everything looks good!

Regards,
Jim

384 is (I think) the number of permutations of the
quadratic formin section 3.A of the thesis.
