Jim, I'm off to SIGGRAPH.  I'll not be reading email religiously, if at all,
so don't be surprised if I don't reply immediately to any questions/comments
you have about the paper over the next week.
Let's try to polish this baby off as soon as I get back.
If you don't have any strenuous objections, I'd like to view the 
optimization solution as a longer-term inquiry independent of this paper,
since that could take a while to implement and test, as well as the fact
that its nonrational, expensive nature seems at odds with the flavour
of the rest of the paper.  How does that sound?

Any quick questions/comments about your recent reading
before I leave?  (I'll probably be in the office tomorrow sometime.)

Cheers,
John
