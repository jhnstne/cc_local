Dear John,

I somewhat have the feeling that you felt attacked
when I made some comments (questions) after your
SIAM talk. In case I have offended you in any way,
I would like to apologize for that. I just wanted
to mention the work of Juettler, Wagner and myself
on rational motion design, since I got the impression
you are not aware of it. Unfortunately, I am sometimes
not able to say these things in an appropriate form
and afterwards I regret it a lot.

Hoping that you are not too upset, I remain

with best regards,

Helmut

Helmut, 

I appreciate your note.  
I am undoubtedly too sensitive about comments after a talk, and 
interpret them as attacks rather than constructive help.
It is probably because of the passion that we all feel for our work,
and the wish to have it accepted and appreciated.
It was very good of you to get back to me about this.
I will be sure to look over your work on rational motion more carefully.
I have the highest respect for your work in geometric design.

Best regards,
John
