Thanks for the comments.
I'll add the note about 'most natural', as well as your earlier comment
about further explaining the spiralling toward the origin.
It's hard to understand behaviour in 4d, where the covariant acceleration
effects are seen.  The better approximation to geodesy of the nearest
neighbour explains a bit, but not all, as you rightly suggest.
Not all of the examples show a huge difference, but the ones upon which 
our method beats other methods by a lot seem also to be the ones where the 
nearest neighbour is significantly better than 'on S3'.

I'll check out your thesis.
And 384 is an interesting number.  Where does it come from?

SIGGRAPH had its moments.  For one thing, I attended some courses
(on motion editing and visualizing quaternions) that were talking
about quaternion splines but weren't aware of our spline,
which happened to solve all of the problems that they were mentioning
with quaternion splines (closed form, efficiency).
I informed the speakers of our work and will send them copies of our paper.
I may add a couple of sentences to the paper emphasizing that we
have a closed form which allows derivatives to be taken easily,
which seems a big deal in spacetime optimization of motion.
Also a couple of references.

I'll hope to get the paper out the door soon to TOG.

Best,
jj

P.S. You MUST go see the Getty Center in LA.  
The architecture is staggering.
