\title{On the relationship between Euler's 4-squares theorem, 
	stereographic projection, and rational curves on S^3}

We want the facility to set the end tangents of curves on the 3-sphere,
so that curves can be smoothly spliced together.
This allows a divide-and-conquer approach to curve fitting.

\begin{lemma}
Let $P=C(\hat{t})=(p1,p2,p3,p4)$ be a point of the S3-curve $C(t)$ 
with tangent $C'(\hat{t}) = (t1,t2,t3,t4)$.
Then the associated tangent of the curve $M^{-1}(C(t))$ is
	(t2 
That is, under the map $M^{-1}$, tangents are mapped as:
	$C'(t)  \rightarrow (M^{-1}(C(t)))'$ \\
	$(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) + s(x'_1,x'_2,x'_3,x'_4) \mapsto 
	 M^{-1}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) 
      + s(\frac{x'_2 \alpha - x_2 \alpha'}{\alpha^2},
	  \frac{x'_3 \alpha - x_3 \alpha'}{\alpha^2},
	  \frac{x'_4 \alpha - x_4 \alpha'}{\alpha^2},
	  \frac{-x'_1 \alpha - (1-x_1)\alpha'}{\alpha^2})$
where $\alpha = \sqrt{2 - 2x_1}, $\alpha' = -\frac{x'_1}{\alpha}$.
\end{lemma}
\prf
Simple differentiation of $M^{-1}(C(t))$.
\QED

Thus, if we want a spherical curve to have a prescribed end tangent,
we can set the desired endtangent of the endpoint in image space
using this lemma and fit the image curve to this tangent.

see page FOO1

If we are setting the tangent on the spherical curve independently, 
notice that the tangent vector $C'(t_0)$ must be orthogonal to the vector $C(t_0)$
since the tangent at any point of $C(t)$ must lie in the sphere's tangent plane
at this point.)
