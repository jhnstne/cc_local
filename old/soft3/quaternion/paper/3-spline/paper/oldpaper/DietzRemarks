Dear Prof. Johnstone,

I read with interest the manuscript by James Williams and you of the paper

     ``Rational interpolating curves on the 3-sphere''.

You suggest to use a map M from P^4 to S^3 in order to construct curves that
interpolate orientations described by unit quaternions. Concerning this
map I would like to make the following remarks:

- M(a,b,c,d,1) is nothing else than stereographic projection of the
  point (0,a,b,c,d) onto S^3 with the center of projection (1,0,0,0,1).

- The inverse map M^(-1) onto a hyperplane of P^4 is a projective map,
  e.g. in the X_5=1 -hyperplane:
       M^(-1) (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = (x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5-x_1,1)

- Interpolating curves constructed by M depend on the chosen coordinate system,
  since the center of projection is fixed. The curve may have singularities
  if the projection center is interpolated.

- If the P^4-curve is set up as cubic curve, not all sextic rational curves
  on the S^3 are representable by M. In this sence the representation is not
  complete.

- There is no reason why a cubic B-spline curve should be converted to
  Bezier representation when mapped to the S^3. How to multiply B-splines
  can be found in e.g.
  Morken, K.: Some identities for products and degree raising of splines,
              Construct. Approx. 7 (1991), 195-208
  Dietz, R.; Hoschek, J.; Juettler, B.: Rational patches on quadrics,
              Computer-Aided Design 27 (1995), 27-40


Best regards
