put quaternion curve into B-spline form by degree reduction to degree 3?

choose different default point on inverse image line?

observe that M^{-1}(unit quaternion) still lies on the sphere.
	this obfuscates the development in the conference paper,
	since it is easier to imagine it being sent off to general 4-space

	this motivates our choice of M^{-1}(p,q,r,s,1) rather
	than some other point on the projective line:
	since it lies on the sphere, we guarantee that the space
	curve is constrained to a reasonable bounded region, without
	wild fluctuations
doublecheck that C^2 continuity is preserved by testing C^2 conditions
	on control polygon of spherical curve
try out speed control using non-Euclidean metric knot sequencing
as in Section 8.1

does quaternion.inpathological's problem arise from a cusp?
	check against Lemma 9.1
