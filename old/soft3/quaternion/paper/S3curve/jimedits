Here's my incorporation of your edits, finally.
(Had to hack on the implementation all day to get
some better pictures.)
And in the next mail the new paper.
Please look them over and give me your comments.

Some other changes I made:

-I added an explanation of the cusp conditions after the Cusp lemma.

-In Section 4, I clarified that ANY interpolation method
can be used in 4-space (so that nobody can write a different
paper simply using, say, Catmull-Rom splines instead
of B-splines).

- added some sentences to the Conclusions, to emphasize that
  one of the main points is the maps to and from the
  sphere, which allows us to tap into classical
  methods of point interpolation.

- I promised a video if accepted, which should be doable
	based on my implementations.

- I changed the notation for projective space to
	the graphics convention, homogeneous
	coordinate last.  THis is a slightly
	dangerous shift (esp since I did it at 10pm last night
	when I was groggy, please look out for any typos)
	but I forgot that we are sending this 
	to graphics people, who always list the
	homogeneous coord last and may get confused
	or annoyed by our notation.
	Ken Sloan, a veteran of Graphics Interface,
	pointed this oversight out to me.

I will send you a postscript file with pictures as soon as I've translated
all of them from SGI format to ps.

EDIT #	PAGE	

1	3	"...which leads to a system of equations approach..."
		I believe ours could just as easily be a system of
		equations based on the mail I sent you about Minv.

  This is the way that I attacked the Minv issue.
  I made an observation about our inverse images
  as points rather than lines in the Related Work
  section.  Also, I added a paragraph
  at the end of Section 6.
  Please give me your opinion.

  P.S. For our work, it is a big win that we can
  simply say `apply classical point interpolation
  technique in 4-space', for readability and usability.
  However, suppose this wasn't an issue.
  What would we buy by using the approach of Dietz et. al.,
  where inverse images are lines in projective space?
  Anything?


2	5	"We want a rational map from 4-space...."
		Perhaps we should define rational map explicitly

	Done.

3	5	"Step 1 is well understood.."
		Point out that there are two choices for each quaternion?

	I don't think that we need to discuss this point because
	it is a well known trait of quaternion, fully discussed in
	Shoemake (which we point them to) and Barr,
	and with a good solution.
	I want steps 1 and 3-4 to be black boxes which are
	factored out of the algorithm so that we can concentrate
	all of our attention on steps 2 and 5.

4	5	The result is from number theory, should we point out
		the work done by Dietz in transferring Lebes. formula
		to the polynomial ring and mention that our formula also
		transfers to the polynomial ring in the same way.

	We only use the map on a point by point basis,
	for example f(t) = M(C(t)) means f(t_0) = M(C(t_0)),
	where C(t_0) is of course a point.
	So I don't think that we have to get into the polynomial ring issue.
	Dietz et. al. have to jump through more hoops because they
	are proving it is necessary and sufficient in the polynomial ring case.

5	6	"We are not as lucky in 4-space..."
		We are not as fortunate with M as it constitutes a
		sufficient but not necessary condition for forming a
		pythagorean quintuple (quadruple?).

	I think that the next sentence makes it clear what I mean by `we
	are not as lucky', in particular, `M does not map onto the set
	of all rational interpolating curves'.
	I don't want to belabor this point.
	I had an earlier longer version where I discussed
	more about this, but I think this version is more effective.
	This is more of a theoretical point that would be of more interest
	to a CAGD rather than graphics crowd.

6	7	Why do we choose positive sqrt?  How can we justify this.

	In the proof, if the negative sqrt is used, 
	we get Minv(M(p,q,r,s,1)) = (2ps,2qs,2rs,2s^2,-2s) = (-p,-q,-r,-s,1),
	which shows that this map is not the inverse, right?

7	7	some properties of M and Minv we might mention:
			Minv(kq) = sqrt(k)Minv(q)
			M(kx) = k^2*M(x)
			M(Minv(kq)) = M(sqrt(k)Minv(q)) = kM(Minv(q))

	See end of Section 6.

8	8	"...(compare () and ()." 
		Is there a paren missing here?

	Right.

9	9	I did not see a close bracket "]" in the first equation

	Right.

10	10	Section 8.2 is a little unclear to me.  "If a curve segment
		is k times longer..."  longer than?  I think that a figure
		might help here, showing subdivision and measuring segments.

	So that I can get this off to you,
	I'll send you something on this later.
	A figure may not be possible but I'll try to clarify the text.

11	11	"...defined below and k=CC'/CC."
		This should actually be CC/CC' because k is on the opposite
		side as it is in the proof on page 12 (I think)

	Right.  I have corrected it by keeping k the same 
		and switching C' and C, since I want
		to make sure C.C is in the denominator
		(we can be sure it isn't 0 by condition 1,
		unlike C.C')

12	11	when you say C(t) is a cusp, maybe it should be a 
		definite t like t sub 0 or something to distinguish it 
		from the general "t"

	Right.  I've changed it there and elsewhere in the statement
		and proof.

13	12	I think that this is an optimal place to include a table
		something like:
		
		-------------------------------------------------
		S	|	=0		|	!=0
		--------------------------------------------------
		S'	|			|
			-----------------------------------------
		=  0	|			|
			-----------------------------------------
		!= 0	|			|
		-------------------------------------------------

		and fill in the boxes with the relevant conditions.

	Problem is that I don't see any overlap in conditions, so
	I don't see how to make this type of table.
	Hopefully my added commentary after the lemma is enough
	for purposes of clarification.

14	12	"Multiplying by ||C(t)||^2"  
		this should be cubed I believe

	Right.

15	12	The eqn: ||C||^2C' - (C dot C')C = 0
		is a vector equation so it should be = (0,0,0,0)

	Right.

16	12	General comment:  why use two different representations
		for || C(t) ||, the radical may make it more confusing
		to read

	I used the radical because I thought it made the
	evaluation of the derivative of the quotient
	easier to see.  I think it's still OK.

17	14	BIBLIO -- is Pletinckx the actual spelling?

	Believe it or not, yes!

18	14	BIBLIO -- should "PH Space Curves" be included?

	I don't think we should include this: PH curves are
	peripheral to this paper, so one reference is more than
	enough.
