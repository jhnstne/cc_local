Jim, I think that once you've looked over the paper
you'll find that we've each done quite a bit on this
paper.  My take on authorship is that alphabetical
is the natural way, unless there is only a supervisory 
role or unless there is a collection of papers, which
can then be alternated back and forth (as for instance
I did with Shene on our set of papers).
Alphabetical ordering is very well accepted in the
community, as well, so you don't have to be concerned
about any stigma attached to it.
I know that we've gone some blind alleys with this work,
such as the Pythagorean hodograph work, which can
lead to frustration over the amount of time spent.
