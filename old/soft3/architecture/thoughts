Quadric
-------

A quadric surface is an algebraic surface of degree 2.
An algebraic surface is an implicit surface where $f(x,y,z)$ is a polynomial.
An implicit surface is the zeroset of $f(x,y,z)=0$.
Unlike other algebraic surfaces (except for the trivial case of planes),
the quadric surfaces can be completely classified, as
ellipsoids (which includes spheres), 
cylinders (with any conic as cross-section), 
hyperbolic paraboloids (or saddles),
hyperboloids of one or two sheets, 
and cones.
The cone, circular cylinder and sphere are called the natural quadrics (?).
The type of a quadric can be determined from the coefficients of its defining polynomial.
The polynomial may be expressed as a matrix expression:
x^t A x = 0 where A = [...].
The classification is based on the determinant and subdeterminants of this matrix...

Architects who need to be covered: Le Corbusier, 
	Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (Bauhaus founders)
	Alvar Aalto, Le Corbusier (other developers of International Style in 1920's)


Movements:

International Style
	- influenced by technology, which was breaking down borders (rail connections)
	  and the ability to mass-produce
	- 'fascination with the machine' illustrated by Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926)
	- Communism influenced consciousness to globalism (1917)
	- Le Corbusier writings (1920's)
	- search for functional simplicity (p. 17, Kahn's 'International Style')
	- dubbed 'International Style' in 1932 at the MOMA exhibit organized by Philip Johnson and
	  Henry-Russell Hitchcock
	- 'Architecture as Volume': first principle of Hitchcock/Johnson's in their monograph
	  'The International Style: Architecture since 1922': floors freed up by reinforced concrete columns
	- often visible columns supporting underneath
	- Hitcock/Johnson:
		- seamlessness: 'smooth unbroken skin', flat roof, window as most important element,
		   seamless windows not interrupting the facade, smooth materials (again for seamlessness),
		- regularity: 'typically with columns equally spaced' or cellular structure of Gropius'
		  Bauhaus Building; symmetry is not necessary and even discouraged
		- curved surfaces are fine (but invariably extruded curved surfaces?)
		- horizontality
		- 'avoidance of applied decoration': simplicity; use of sculpture and painting for ornament;
		  natural restrained colors
		- contrast to nature (but set in nature)
		   (p. 67-8 of Khan's International Style)
	- public housing and factories are popular, for social context
	- William Jordy (quoted on p. 78 of Khan's 'International Style'):
	  'The aims of simplification and purification, providing it with a morality of Calvinist austerity'
 	  'symbolic objectivity'
	- Philip Johnson's revised definition in 1960's, as stated by Kahn in 'International Style', p. 80:
	  'structural honesty, repetitive modular rhythms, clarity expressed by large expanses of glass,
	   flat roofs, the box as the container, and no ornamentation.'

Louis Sullivan coins 'form follows function' in the essay 'The tall office building,
	artistically considered' (1896) but it goes back to Vitruvius in 1st century AD
Neue Sachlichkeit (new objectivity) of Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, 1924: 
	'began to be used to denote an objective and rational approach to painting, 
	and sometimes to architecture' (p. 16, Khan's 'International Style')

Rationalism
	- 'The Rationalists viewed design as a primary social and ethical activity,
	   and called for economically affordable building.
	   They further advocated industrial technologies of standardization and
	   prefabrication at all scales, from that of city planning to design 
	   of objects.' (p. 18, Khan's 'International Style')
	- MIAR (Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale), 1931
	- strongly related to Functionalism

Bauhaus
	- founded by Walter Gropius (Weimar, Germany, 1919)
	- 'The school aimed to end the isolation of the arts one from another
	   and to train craftsmen and artists in a cooperative effort.'
	   (p. 21 of Khan's 'International Style').
	- Klee and Kandinsky (and later Itten) taught a course on color and form
	- Josef Albers and Marcel Breuer were successful graduates
	- moved to Dessau in 1926 into Gropius' Bauhaus Building
	- Hannes Meyer (Communist) became director in 1928,
	  then Mies van der Rohe in 1930 (after Meyer forced to resign)
	- Dessau terminates grant in 1932, pressured by Nazis: Bauhaus moves to Berlin
	- Hitler closes it down in 1933
	- Gropius quote of 1913: 'Exactly stamped form devoid of all accident,
	  clear contrasts, the ordering of members, the arrangement of like parts
	  in series ...' (quoted on p. 24 of Khan's 'International Style')
	- quoted from Wolf von Eckardt, it 'created the patterns and set the
	  standards of present-day industrial design; it helped to invent modern
	  architecture; it altered the look of everything from the chair you are
	  sitting in to the page you are reading now.' (p. 26, Kahn's 'International
	  Style')

Le Corbusier
	- actually Charles-Edouard Jeanneret
	- adopted his maternal grandfather's name in 1920 (born in 1887, died in 1965)
	- machine \`{a} habiter (machine for living in), 1921 in L'Esprit Nouveau
	- Five Points: cube on reinforced concrete pillars, strip windows, 
		       open plan, freed facade, roof terrace, 

good example of curtain wall: Sir Evan Williams' Boots Factory (Beeston, England 1930-32)
	p. 57 of Kahn's International Style

Mies van der Rohe
	- moved to US in 1938
	- 'whenever technology reaches its real fulfillment it transcends into architecture'
	  (quoted on p. 95 of Khan's International Style)
	- Note: in walking around a set of extruded buildings, the visibility behaves essentially like a 2d scene
	- good orthogonal scene of polygons for this walkthrough is Mies' IIT campus (p. 94 of Khan's Int. Style)
	- IIT campus buildings' aligned but staggered nature allows visibility (vistas) and follows the 
	  intersecting planes principle
	- words that describe his architecture: 'clarity', 'absolute command of the technology', 'less is more'
	  (Khan p. 96 of Int. Style) 
	  [changed to 'less is a bore' in later slamming of International Style and Modernism; p. 224 of Khan's IS]
	- 'His search was to subtract and distill the structure [of Chicago's 19th C. tall buildings] and expression
	   until he arrived at "almost nothing", an idea that he developed in his axiom "less is more".'
	   p. 125 of Khan's IS
	- 'I don't want to be interesting.  I want to be good...For me novelty has no interest."
	  (quoted on p. 125 of Khan's International Style)
	- The saying "God is in the details." is attributed to him although noone heard him say it.
	  Flaubert said "Le Bon Dieu est dans le d\'{e}tail."

Piet Mondrian
	- aesthetic doctrine of Neo-Plasticism, using a limited vocabulary of shapes (horizontal and vertical lines)
	  and colors (red, yellow and blue -- the primary triad -- and black, white, gray)
	  (http://momawas.moma.org/collection/depts/paint_sculpt/blowups/paint_sculpt_018.html)

Eero Saarinen
	- son of Eliel Saarinen, worked with him until his death in 1950
	- designed St. Louis' Gateway Arch: a catenary
	- Kresge Auditorium and Chapel, MIT
	- TWA Terminal
	- David Ingalls Ice Hockey Rink at Yale (1958-62)
	- Terminal Building at Dulles International Airport (1958-63)

Louis Kahn
	- "light as a definer of space" (p. 182 of Khan's 'International Style') (how?)
	- "structures based on the tetrahedron" (which ones?)
	-
