\title{Convex hulls and visibility graphs of plane curves from bitangents}

Once the bitangents of a collection of curves are known,
it becomes feasible to build many secondary structures at a reasonable cost,
such as the convex hull and the visibility graph.
These algorithms have been classically developed for polygons,
but we consider their construction for plane curves.
The calculation of the convex hull and visibility graph 
in a smooth environment, as opposed
to a polygonal environment built from a discrete sampling of the smooth
environment, can significantly simplify the structures and improve 
their accuracy.

A bitangent is a line that is tangent to a collection of curves
at two or more distinct points.
We have recently developed a new algorithm for the computation
of bitangents of plane curves, as well as the tangents 
of a curve through a given point.
These bitangents and tangents define the edges of a visibility graph
of a collection of curves.
The visibility graph is an important structure in motion planning
and visibility analysis.
We discuss the details of this construction and the improvements
over a polygonal visibility graph.
A special subset of the bitangents also define the convex hull.
We show how to find this subset efficiently, using a smooth analog
of giftwrapping.
Finally, we show how the local extrema of a curve can be easily found
using a variation of our construction of bitangents.
