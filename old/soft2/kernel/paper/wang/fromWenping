John, 

	You gave a clear discussion of the main idea.
I enjoyed reading it. Maybe some parts can be made 
more rigorous. I believe more basics about duality is 
needed to make it readable by an ordinary CAGD reader. 

Best, 

Wenping

==========================

	
Main comments:

1) The definition of *kernel* should be made rigorous, by stating clearly 
that the kernel is a closed set (i.e. including the boundary points.)
In Lemma 2, it is implied that the kernel does *not* include boundary points, 
while in the subsequent discussion it allows the boundary points to be 
part of the kernel. These inconsistences can be removed easily. 

2) In Section 4 (page 6), the reason provided for not considering self-intersecting 
curve is not convincing. Considering a crunode on a planar cubic curve, it is not 
immediately clear why the points inside the knot has to be passed by some tangent 
of the curve. I think the key is that the insideness of the curve is not well-defined, 
so neither is the kernel. (Another interesting problem is to consider the kernel 
of an open and non-self-intersecting planar curve).

3) I believe the final algorithm can be stated entirely in the prime space with 
referring to the dual space for trimming $C^*$. See below. 

4) Some key results should/can be established rigorously and stated as theorems, 
such as the following. 

Let $h$ be the closed half-plane defined by an inflectional tangent, 
containing the interior points of the region bounded by curve C 
in the neighborhood of the tangential point. Let $H$ be the set of 
all these half-planes. Let $G$ be the intersection of the $h$'s in $H$.

Theorem. Kernel(C) = Int(C) \cap G. 

Theorem. $G$ is empty iff Kernel(C) is empty. (i.e. $G$ is a kernel set.)

Theorem. The boundary of kernel(C) consists of line segments on inflectional 
tangents and convex segments from curve $C$. 

Although these results have been stated or mentioned in the paper, 
I feel they need to be put down as theorems 
with rigoruous proof so as to tighten the logical argument. 

5) The points in the set K defined in step 2 of algorithm 3 (page 9) and 
computed through trimming in the dual space can be computed by simply computing 
the intersection of all half-planes in the set H as defined in (4) above 
in the prime space. Computing the common intersection of $n$ half-planes takes 
$O(nlogn)$ time. So trimming, hence the dual space, is not needed in the final 
algorithm, and it will be used in theoretical understanding. (The appearance of 
$\epsilon$ in section 4.1 does not look harmonic in the paper). 
Then there arises a new problem: Gershon Elber knows that the kernel can be 
computed by intersecting all the inflectional tangents, as he indicated
at Dagsthul. If this is the case, I don't know what remains is new. 
Maybe you can check with him. 

A remark, the dual version of computing the intersection of a set of half-planes
is the problem of computing the convex hull of a set of points. 

Detailed comments: 

1) Definition 1.1 (page 2) a planar curve --> a closed planar curve.
	 Maybe even non-self-intersection can be assumed here. 

2) Defintion 2.1. (a/c/ b/c) --> (a/c, b/c, 1). 
	I feel using the homogeneous coordinates is better since it leaves 
a place for points at infinity. 

3) Section 3 (page 5): The leading paragraph about the shrinking and 
expanding to get kernel and convex hull is too vague to make a valid point. 
I don't see how the discussion that follows supports or relates 
to this interpretation of the relationship between the two. 

4) Proof of Theorem 3.1 (page 5). It seems that only one direction has 
been proved. It is not mentioned why
a tangent to the convex hull of $C^*$ gives a boundary point of the kernel. 

5) page 5, line -5: *bitangent* has not been defined up to this point. 
Also, a line segment on the boundary of the kernel should correspond to a 
bundle of tangents supported at a cusp of the convex hull of $C^*$, 
instead of a bitagnent. 

6) The term *concave curve* is not a standard one. *Nonconvex* sounds better. 

7) page 5, line -4: *every concavity must contain an inflection points". 
What is *a concavity*? This statement is not rigoruous. 

8) Proof of Lemma 4.3 (page 8): The description of pivoting used here 
is a bit loose. A more rigorous proof from the viewpoint of differetial 
geometry should be given.

9) page 9, line 18: Although the kernel (or its interior, for this matter) is convex, 
it needs to be shown that the kernel points in $S$ are not collinear, so their centroid can be 
an interior point of the kernel. 

10) Please indicate the location of the origin in the left figure of Figure 4.
