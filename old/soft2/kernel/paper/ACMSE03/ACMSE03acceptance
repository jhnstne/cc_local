First reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the paper <<<

This paper discusses a theoretical study on locationg kernels for a plane
curve. Although other approaches exit to achieve the same purpose, the
algorithm presented seems to be efficient and provides extra features.

Second reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the paper <<<

A couple of new algorithms for computing kernels are given. Relationships
between convex hulls and kernels are presented.



          >>> Comments <<<

Well written paper.



          >>> Points in favour or against <<<

None.

Third reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the paper <<<

This paper establishes a structural relationship between the kernel of a
planar closed curve in primal space, and the convex hull in dual space. By
this duality, an efficient algorithm for the calculation of the kernel can
be reduced to the calculation of the convex hull in dual space.



          >>> Comments <<<

See below.



          >>> Points in favour or against <<<

In favor:

A well-written paper, clear and concise. An interesting, and somewhat
profound result.

Against:

None that I could see.

Fourth reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the paper <<<

New algorithms to compute the kernel of a closed curve in the Euclidean
plane are presented. Although optimally efficient algorithms have
previously been developed, the authors nice approach is based on duality
between points and lines, thereby reducing the computation of the kernel to
the computation of a convex hull (of the corresponding tangential curve.)



          >>> Comments <<<

A well written article on a beautiful subject. A couple of comments
(minor): 1. In the definition of the kernel, p.1, the line PQ is the *open*
line segment? 2. Is the speed (efficiency) ot these proposed algorithms the
same (up to a constant) as the optimal one developed by Lee and Preparata?
3. Has the dual curve been studied in the real projective 2-space at all?



          >>> Points in favour or against <<<

In favor: A very good paper on a classic subject. Against: Comparison with
existing efficient algorithms lacking.
