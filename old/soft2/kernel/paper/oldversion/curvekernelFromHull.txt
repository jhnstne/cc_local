\title{Kernels from hulls}

\begin{abstract}
The kernel of a plane curve $C$ is the locus of points that can see every point of $C$. (4)
Since a point of the kernel maximizes visibility of an object, the kernel is a fundamental
structure in the development of a theory of visibility for lighting, motion and efficient rendering. (2)
In computational geometry, the kernel of a polygon has long been an object of study.(1)
In this paper, we consider the kernel of a plane curve. (3)
The kernel of a curve can be studied in dual space, using the classical geometric duality between lines and points. (5)
Much is revealed about the kernel's structure by mapping it to dual space.
In particular, the kernel in primal space becomes the convex hull in dual space.
Using this dual relationship, any kernel computation can be reduced to a convex hull computation.
Equally importantly, the structure of the kernel can be understood from the structure of the hull.

Since curves with nontrivial kernels are mapped to curves in dual space that necessarily contain cusps,
the degenerate hull ...
