ruled surfaces:

	2 parametric curves --> ruled
	1 curve  --> tangent developable
	*implicit equation, point --> generator
	*implicit equation --> directrix
	*implicit equation --> display using directrix and generators 
	       (don't need parametric rep of surface)
	visualize generators
	animate the generators
	set of generators (line segments, actually) --> ruled surface display

	classical ruled surfaces: ruled quadrics, doubly ruled surfaces

	intersection with line
	(intersection with another ruled surface)
	
	(unrolling a developable into a plane)
	(shortest path on a developable; ruled)
	
	(related to bitangent developables)

	(explore connections to visibility)
