This directory contains a Latex file (jj.tex) and the associated 30
fonts that encode the images of this paper.
These fonts were created by 'bm2font' from the bitmap images.

bm2font creates special fonts for each image (both .300pk and .tfm fonts).
Before dealing with the Latex file, these fonts must be placed in a 
directory reachable from the TEXFONTS path in .cshrc.
Finally, when you convert the .dvi file to Postscript,
you must use the '-d 300' option so that 300 dpi will be
used, which is the resolution at which the image fonts have been created.

Thus, to prepare a Postscript file from this material,
please follow these steps:

1) copy the font files into a directory reachable from your TEXFONTS path
   (or create a new directory and add it to your TEXFONTS path)
   
2) latex jj.tex

3) dvips -D 300 -o jj.ps jj.dvi  
   (or the related translator from dvi to ps that you use).
   
So that you can tell if the above steps have worked successfully,
I am also including a Postscript version of my paper
to compare against.

If you need help or clarification in any way, please let me know
at (205) 975-5633 or jj@cis.uab.edu
Thanks.
