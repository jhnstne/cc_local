\begin{itemize}
\item
Another example of duality is the duality between the vertices and faces of
a graph, which has been productively used in computational geometry
to relate the computation of the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation.
\item
The tangential a-curves and b-curves cooperate to represent all of the tangents,
Each individually has a blind spot, but together they see everything.
much like the three Fates that share an eyeball.
\item
If a representation of the tangent space of a {\em space} curve (a nonplanar curve in 3-space)
was wanted, the \plucker tangential curve would become useful.
\item 
the increase in degree of the tangential curve relates to the class of the related curve
\item
What about cusps? points with undefined tangents or zero tangents? for the tangential curve representation
Not a problem: these are zero measure, so tangential curve is still defined
\end{itemize}
