A proposal for the study of bitangents

Light travels in a straight line.   (More precisely, ignoring relativistic effects or restricting oneself to
the surface of the earth, light travels in a straight line.)   The shortest path between two points is a straight line.  
Hence, lines are important to the study of lighting, visibility and shortest path motion.
Among the 4-dimensional manifold of lines in 3-space, there is a select subset of lines that define changes in lighting,
visibility or shortest path for a given scene of obstacles.  These lines are the tangents and bitangents of the scene,
as illustrated in Figure X for a 2d scene.  Thus, the tangents and bitangents of a scene effectively define the lighting, 
visibility and motion structure of the scene.  This has been recognized and well studied for polyhedral scenes, with
work on visibility skeletons and complexes for visibility, --- for lighting, and --- [Sharir cell decomposition] for motion. 
Likewise, for smooth scenes, tangents and their cousin, the silhouette,  have been fully studied and are now well understood. 
However, the bitangent and its related structures are not yet fully understood, especially computationally.  
We propose to develop a computational framework for bitangents and related structures, 
and fully tie these structures into the computation of visibility, lighting and motion for a smooth scene.

We shall allow various representations of the underlying smooth scene, such as Bezier curves, Bezier surfaces and NURBS;
subdivision curves and surfaces; and algebraic curves and surfaces.

The humble tangent

Since the tangents of a smooth curve, and the tangent planes (or normals) of a smooth surface,
are absolutely fundamental to geometric modeling and graphics, from the imposition of C^i and G^i continuity to shading, 
their computation is very well understood.
Since an understanding of tangents is necessary to a study of bitangents, we begin by reviewing
the computation of tangents of a Bezier curve, algebraic curve and subdivision curve.
The tangent vector of a Bezier curve at $C(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n b_i B_i^n(t)$ 
is $C'(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} n(b_{i+1}-b_i) B_i^{n-1}(t)$.
We introduce the concept of the {\bf tangent hodograph}: the curve swept out by the tangent vector translated to the origin.
The tangent vector at $C(t)$ can be interpreted as a point on the tangent hodograph $C'(t)$.
The hodograph of a Bezier curve is itself a Bezier curve.
Thus, the computation of a tangent vector of a Bezier curve of degree $n$ 
is equivalent to the evaluation of a Bezier curve of degree $n-1$.
The tangent vector of a Bezier curve can also be interpreted in terms of the de Casteljau triangle at $C(t)$ (Figure Y):
it is the difference vector of the two elements in the penultimate column.

The tangent of a nonsingular point $P$ of the algebraic curve $F(x)=0$ is the line $\sum_i F_i(P) x_i=0$,
where $x = (x_0,x_1,x_2)$, $F_i = \partial F(x) / \partial x_i$, $P$ and $x$ are projective coordinates, 
and $F(x)$ is a homogeneous polynomial.

The tangent of a subdivision curve is computed using a tangent mask, as follows.
Consider a subdivision curve defined by the local subdivision matrix S.
Let $e_i$ be the eigenvectors of S with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ ($\lambda_0 \geq \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \ldots$).
For a valid subdivision matrix S, the eigenvectors will define a basis and the eigenvalues will satisfy $\lambda_0 = 1$, 
$\lambda_1 < 1$, and $\lambda_2<\lambda_1$.
Consider the control point $p$ of the subdivision curve
and its expression in the eigenvector basis: $p = \sum a_i e_i$.
The limit point associated with $p$ is simply $a_0$, the 'coefficient' associated with the dominant eigenvector
(since the influence of all other eigenvectors disappears in the limit, as they are multiplied by increasing powers
of eigenvalues less than 1).
This $a_0$ is itself computed using the dominant left eigenvector $E_0$ of S: $a_0 = E_0 p$ (see Stollnitz appendix).
In short, the limit point of a control point $p$ is $E_0 p$, where $E_0$ is the {\bf left} eigenvector of the local
subdivision matrix associated with the dominant eigenvalue $\lambda_0$.
Analogously (see Schroeder, p. 42 of SIGGRAPH notes), the tangent at the limit point associated with a control point $p$
is $a_1 = E_1 p$, where $E_1$ is the left eigenvector of S associated with the eigenvalue $\lambda_1$.

Using the refinement equation for general B-splines (an expression for the cubic B-spline in terms of dilated and translated
copies of itself; see (2.1), p. 26 of Schroeder SIGGRAPH notes), we have the following refinement equation for cubic B-splines:
\[
B_3(t) = \frac{1}{8} [B_3(2t) + 4B_3(2t-1) + 6B_3(2t-2) + 4B_3(2t-3) + B_3(2t-4)]
\
or equivalently
\[
B_3(t-1) = \frac{1}{8} [B_3(2t-2) + 4B_3(2t-3) + 6B_3(2t-4) + 4B_3(2t-5) + B_3(2t-6)] 
\]
from which the following subdivision matrix for cubic B-splines can be derived:
\[
[ \ldots B(t) B(t-1) \ldots ] = 
[ \ldots B(2t) B(2t-1) B(2t-2) B(2t-3) B(2t-4) \ldots] 
\frac{1}{8} 
\left( \begin{array}{llll}
           & 1 \\
           & 4 \\
\ldots & 6 & 1 & \ldots \\
           & 4 & 4 \\
           & 1 & 6 \\
           &    & 4 \\
           &    & 1
\end{array}
\right)
\]
The associated local subdivision matrix for cubic B-spline curves is a 5x5 submatrix of the infinite subdivision matrix, 
since the invariant neighbourhood for a point of a cubic B-spline curve is of size 5, as follows: % Schroeder, p. 37
\[
S_3 = 
\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 6 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 4 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 6 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 & 4 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 6 & 1
\right)
\]
The dominant left eigenvector of $S_3$ is $(0,1,4,1,0)$ with eigenvalue 1.
The second dominant left eigenvector of $S_3$ is $(0,-1,0,1,0)$ with eigenvalue $\frac{1}{2}$.
This leads to the evaluation mask: % Schroeder, p. 40
\[
p_i^{\infty} = \frac{1}{6}(p_{i-1} + 4p_i + p_{i+1})
\]
and tangent mask % Schroeder, p. 42
\[
t_i^{\infty} = p_{i+1} - p_{i-1}
\]

Tangent spaces

The tangent is a local phenomenon, depending only on the local behaviour of the curve,
but the bitangent is a global phenomenon, depending on the global behaviour of the tangents
on two curves.
Consequently, in working with bitangents, we need to work with the entire tangent space of a curve.
This section discusses the representation of tangent spaces of curves.

Qualitative work on the bitangent

There has been work on aspect graphs 
of smooth surfaces in the vision literature, which considers bitangents largely at a symbolic or topological 
(i.e., noncomputational) level, and work of Durand and his colleagues on the qualitative analysis of visibility for 
smooth surfaces.
