\opening{Dear Chee:}

Good to see you at the Computational Geometry Conference.
I enclose three copies of "On the sorting of points along an algebraic curve"
for consideration for publication in the SIAM Journal on Computing.
I also enclose two copies of two unpublished references that are important to
this paper: my thesis and 
"Automatic Parameterization of Rational Curves and Surfaces III: Algebraic
Plane Curves" by S. Abhyankar and C. Bajaj.
A list of people in the community that I think would be well suited 
to referee this paper is the following: Thomas Sederberg (Brigham Young University),
Joe Warren (Rice University), Rida Farouki (IBM Yorktown), Christoff Hoffmann 
(Purdue University), and Vijaya Chandru (Purdue University, School of Industrial
Engineering).
Please address all correspondence regarding this paper to the above address 
and do not hesitate to call me at (301) 338-5560 if there are any questions.

I believe that this version of the material is more amenable to a classroom
presentation, so I would advise using it rather than the thesis if you discuss
this work in a course next year.

Have a good summer.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
