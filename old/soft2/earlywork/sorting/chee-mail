Subject: Reminder

Dear John,
thanks for the reminder.  I just sent another
note to the referee.  I will send you at least
one report before the end of April (my own).

I leave Vancouver on March 30 and will be working
mostly on my book until then. My Berlin email is
	unido!fubinf!fubmat!yap
and address is
	Fachbereich Mathematik
	Freie Universitaet
	Arnimallee 2-6
	D-1000 Berlin 33

Best,  Chee
