Introduction
------------
Throughout history, geometry has been a central discipline in
mathematics. Its development over the centuries has been fueled
by its interaction with areas such as physics, engineering,
architecture and art. Computers have offered new perspectives,
directions and demands on research in geometry. This created a
new discipline in computer science: computational geometry which
assumed a definite shape in the mid-1970s. It is concerned with
the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems.
Like geometry, computational geometry is influenced by the traditional
areas of science, as well as by new areas of research such as
pattern recognition, robotics, computer graphics, computer vision,
CAD-CAM, VLSI-design, etc. The success of computational geometry has
resulted in the need for a new forum where novel ideas and results
can be presented. The new journal COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY provides this.

Aims and Scope
--------------
COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY is a forum for research in theoretical
and applied aspects of computational geometry. The journal publishes
fundamental research in all areas of the subject, as well as disseminating
information on the applications, techniques, and use of computational
geometry.

The journal publishes articles on:
(1) Design and analysis of geometric algorithms
(2) All aspects of computational geometry including
        * numerical
        * graph theoretical
        * combinatorial
(3) Computational geometry solutions to fundamental problems arising in
        * computer graphics
        * pattern recognition
        * robotics
        * image processing
        * CAD-CAM, VLSI design
        * geographic information systems

COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY also contains a special section containing
open problems and concise reports on implementations of computational
geometry tools.

If you wish to submit your paper to COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY, please
send your paper (five copies) to one of the Editors-In-Chief.

The first issue is planned for February 1991.Initially, the journal will be
published in six issues of about 60 pages each.

The Guide for Authors' from the Publishers gives full details regarding
the submission of papers. Copies of the Guide are available from
