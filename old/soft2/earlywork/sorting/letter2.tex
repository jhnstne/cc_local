\opening{Dear Ms. Norris:}

Here is the (final?) draft of the paper `Sorting Points along an Algebraic Curve'.
Yes, the `blurred symbol on pp. 39-41' is an open ``ess'' (i.e., two S's offset
by a small amount to create an ``ess'' that can be distinguished from other uses
of ``ess'' in the paper).
On p. 40 of the marked version, I didn't understand the need to move the top
line left, since it looks much better with all of the formulae lined up, 
so I did not change this.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, at (301) 338-5560.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
