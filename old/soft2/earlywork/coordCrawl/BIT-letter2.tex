\opening{Dear Prof. Froberg:}

I am writing in reference to the paper
`A Localized Method for Intersecting Plane Algebraic Curve Segments' 
(with M. Goodrich) which we had submitted to you in 1989 (paper 89-14).
I would like to notify you that we are withdrawing the paper
from consideration for publication in BIT, for the following reason.
The paper was originally presented at Computer Graphics International
1989.
We were notified this summer that the best papers from this conference
will be published in a special issue of Visual Computer, and our paper
has been chosen.
Thank you very much for your earlier consideration of this paper.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
