Subject: acm abstract

John,
     I read through the abstract and had a couple
of comments/corrections. It's probably too late to
incorporate them in the submitted version, but you
may want to update the file anyway.

1) Section 1, middle of paragraph beginning "The
paper is structured ...". Replace "at the end of
Section 3.2" by "in Section 3.3".

2) Section 2, first paragraph after Definition 2.1
Given reference to [5] and [6] after "offset".

3) Footnote 2 on page 2: extraneous parenthesis at
end of sentence.

4) Section 2, paragraph beginning "Note that if ..."
Move this entire paragraph to Section 1, before para
beginning "The reader is ...". This is because the
unit normal n(u) is used in Eq. (2) but has not yet
been defined.

5) Section 2, end of para beginning "The offset of
...". Change "will remain" to "is actually".

6) Eq. (4) needs period at end.

7) Section 2, below Eq. (5) change "Given any point
${\bf p}$ ..." to "Given any point ${\bf p}=(\alpha,
\beta)$ ...". We use alpha and beta below but haven't
yet defined them to be the coordinates of p.

8) Eq. (7): delete period.

9) Section 2, para above Proposition 2.1: change
"Table 2" to "Table 1".

10) End of Section 2.2: change "Table 2.1" to
"Table 2"

11) Definition 3.1: peculiar linebreak

12) Para below Theorem 3.1: change "(Sections 2
and 2.1)" to "(Section 2.1)".

13) Figure 6 caption, change to "Self-intersections
of the point/ellipse bisector"

14) Theorem 3.3 & its proof:

   (a) given the interests of this audience, we
   may want to quote this result in the abstract

   (b) it would be a good idea to pick a Greek
   letter other than beta for the "oracle" function,
   since we use (alpha,beta) as coordinates of p

   (c) in the proof, I did not understand why,
   after solving for the roots of eqn. (19), we
   have O( (2n-1)/2 ) point-point distance comp-
   utations. Why isn't it just O(2n-1), since the
   polynomial (19) can have 2n-1 odd-multiplicity
   roots (if all roots are simple)?

   (d) In the expression O( (8n-10)*beta(2n-1)
   + (8n-10)*n ), the second term presumably comes
   from the point/point distance computations.
   What is the assumption here concerning the cost
   of a single point/point calculation?

   (e) need bold "b" in b(u) after "untrimmed
   bisector"

   (f) I'm not sure of how you get from the sum
   of O( (8n-10)*beta(2n-1) + (8n-10)*n ) and
   O( (3n-2)*(3n-3)*beta(2n-1) + (3n-2)*(3n-3)*n )
   to the expression quoted in Theorem 3.3 - in
   particular where the term beta( O(9*n**2) )
   comes from. Perhaps I am missing something very
   elementary; my ignorance on these matters is
   rather profound.

   (g) the result concerning the degree of the
   self-intersection polynomial, deduced from the
   fact that the untrimmed bisector is rational,
   is quite nice and we might want to highlight
   it as a separate lemma. This would also make
   the proof of Theorem 3.3 more readable.

15) Remark 3.3: another reason that the degree
of P_i(u) is less than (3n-2)*(3n-3) is that we
must count cusps of b(u) among its "double points"
although these are not self-intersections. We
already know the degree of the cusp polynomial
P_c(u); it is 4n-4, and if all cusps are simple
we could subtract this from (3n-2)*(3n-3). This
does not change your complexity result, since
the number of cusps is only O(n), while the
number of self-intersections is O(n**2).

16) Section 4 cite ref. [4] after "a priori".

17) Eq. (17): change comma to period.

18) Section 5.2, end of para beginning "In order
for ...". References to "Table 5.2" (twice) don't
agree with the relevant equation numbers

19) Eqs. (25) and (26): make these a single equation
using \begin{eqnarray}, since Proposition 5.2 refers
only to Eq. (25)

If possible I would like to have a shot at editing
the file when we get comments back from the referees
(assuming they are favorable).

The full paper has been printed up as IBM Research
Report RC17381. I have sent you some copies in the
mail; could you also send me a few copies of the JHU
report?
