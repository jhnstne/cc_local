Rida,
	Here are some thoughts on the curve-curve bisector problem.

We want to use a local method (given a point on one of the curves, find
the associated point on the bisector) rather than a global method
(find the global equations that must be satisfied for a point to lie on
the bisector and solve them).

Consider the straightforward extension of the point-curve bisector solution:
given a point P on one of the curves (say C1), move out along its normal
until equidistant from P and the other curve C2.
The problem with this solution is that we don't have a 
formula for distance from the curve C2.

Another local approach is to use local curvature information.
You coordinate the motion along the two curves so that normals intersect
at the bisector (or at least at a point equidistant from the two current points
of the curve).
The speed of motion is determined by the curvature:
the higher the curvature, the slower the motion.
The problem that I am encountering is that the need for controlling the speed
of motion seems to require an arc-length parameterization.
(So perhaps this method would work with Pythagorean hodograph curves, but
not general parametrics.)

Does this sound familiar to anything that you have tried?

Rida,
	I like the IMA paper very much.
You have done a great job of smoothly and concisely extracting all 
of the interesting results from the long CAGD paper.

The material on the curve-curve bisector is an excellent contribution.
I like the proof that one can find the points of a point-curve
bisector that contribute to the curve-curve bisector by computing the
intersections with the normal.
This method is satisfying because it is the natural extension of the 
point-curve bisector idea of moving out along the normal from a point 
r(u') on the curve until equidistant from r(u') and P.
In particular, the analogue for the curve-curve bisector seems impossible 
because P becomes a curve and we don't have a closed-formula expression 
for the distance to a curve.
However, the computation of the point-curve bisector w.r.t. r(u') 
and the second curve captures the equidistant locus, 
so we know where to stop when moving out
along the normal: exactly when you hit this point-curve bisector.

I only have the following comments: 

(1) Note that, at the beginning of Remark 2.1, 2.2 and Section 2.5,
there are extraneous >'s in the file you sent me.

(2) In Remark 2.4, should the degree of (2.9) be 4n-3 (rather than 4n-4),
which changes the degree of P_i to 9n^2 - 23n + 12,
or deg(P_i) = 24 for cubics?

(3) Is the following geometric interpretation of (3.8) correct
(I don't fully understand the algebraic transition from (3.7) to (3.8)):
	if you are at an intersection of `neighboring' point-curve bisectors,
	then if you go a `distance' \delta u along the tangent vector at 
	the bisector,
	or \delta \lambda along the direction in which the bisector is tending,
	then you should end up at the same point (at a first order approx)?

(4) When we are revising the CAGD paper, there are a few points that 
might be added from this version:
the added emphasis that the irregular point must lie on the evolute,
the discussion of the use of the Bernstein-Bezier form,
the equations (2.15) and (2.16) about the points-at-infinity polynomial 
for ellipses, and
equation (2.21) about the parameter values of self-intersections on the 
ellipse.

By the way, since I will be finishing up another paper for Edinburgh
next week, I may have to postpone work on the final CAGD paper until
the first week of September.  

I will send you a note about critical points tomorrow.

**********************************************************************

Rida,
	When I looked at your examples which only used self-intersections
and points at infinity, I started to wonder about the necessity
of active points, but I also wondered if they only arose with more
complicated examples.  Your observation about the lack of cusps on the 
bisector, by convexity, and the consequent removal of circular points 
seems to have cleared up the problem.

	Let me try to clarify the issue of active points.
Consider motion along the untrimmed bisector.
Active segments were introduced in order to rigorously establish (in the 
proof of Theorem 3.2 of the technical report)
that the curve must enter the tangent circle at *two distinct* points
when we leave the true bisector (see the proof).
If we know that we are on an active segment, 
then the circle cannot become full from a neighbourhood of q',
so it must be entered from a distinct point.
Therefore, it is easy to establish that a self-intersection occurs.

Suppose that we remove the assumption that we are on an active segment.
The danger that I envisioned was that, while remaining tangent at q',
the curve might begin to enter the circle at q'
(rather than entering at a point distinct from q').
This would not be a self-intersection.
This can happen if the curvature at q' is sharper than the circle
and begins to happen when the curvature at q' is equal to the circle
(i.e., q is the center of curvature).
But in this case, q' is a circular point and q is a cusp on the untrimmed
bisector.
Since the bisector never contains a cusp, even as an endpoint, it seems as
if we can ignore this possibility.

To recap, the active segment was defined in order to ensure that
the curve in the nhood of q' lies completely outside their Cq circle.
It seems that we can remove this strong restriction using the observation
that circular points induce cusps, which cannot lie on the bisector.
This would remove Defn 3.2 (of active point) through the rest of Section 3.1,
with the exception of the observation about the equivalence of 'circular'
points and induced cusps.
We still need points at infinity, so Thm 3.2 would have to cut both
at self-intersections and at points at infinity.

The only thing that still bothers me a bit is that 
we have accounted for circular points, and we still want points at infinity
(class points), but there is no direct explanation of inflection points.
However, since inflection points were introduced in response to the question
'where can the relative position of p and the circle of curvature change?'
rather than by the direct question 'when can the curve enter the tangent circle
at q' ', it is not necessary to account for them.

I will be interested to hear your thoughts on this issue.

				John

P.S. Could you tell me the length of talks at Mathematics of Surfaces?
This is in reference to another Edinburgh paper, which I will present.

John,
       Thanks for the notes; sorry for the delay
in responding -- I was out of the office all morning.
I believe the Edinburgh talks are supposed to be
half an hour. Have you not received the conference
program yet? I got my copy a week or more ago.
       Yes, I was quite excited about the curve/curve
bisector results myself, as I didn't envisage making
so much progress on it at first. We might want to
consider fleshing this out into a proper paper later
on, since the IMA proceedings don't get such a wide
circulation, and the referees liked the point/curve
paper.
       I believe your observations on whether or
not the "circular" points and inflections need to
be considered when trimming are correct, although
I have to read them again more carefully.

                             Rida

John,
        I thought about whether or not we should
keep the "circular" points and points corresponding
to inflections in the trimming procedure, and decided
that I am reluctant to remove them. The arguments you
gave originally about "local occupancy" of the tangent
circle are rigorous and geometrically easy to understand.
The argument about ruling out cusps on the grounds of
convexity, on the other hand, seems indirect and less
satisfying. By keeping the inflections/circular points,
our trimming process is at worst somewhat redundant
(this would also make the revision less painful). Of
course, we could include a comment in the CAGD paper
to the effect that the true bisector cannot have cusps,
and thus splitting the untrimmed bisector at them may
not be essential. Please let me know if you agree with
this plan.

        About the points in your earlier note:

(1) Those extraneous >'s must have been inserted in
    transit; my file doesn't have them.

(2) The degree is 4n-4, rather than 4n-3, because there
    is a cancellation of the leading term in (2.9).

(3) In going from (3.7) to (3.8), I have expanded out
    the right-hand side as a bivariate Taylor series
    and then cancelled the term {\bf b}_\lambda(u)
    on both the left and right; but your "geometric"
    interpretation is essentially correct.

(4) I'll add those items to the CAGD paper (some of
    them are already there).

Please let me know if you agree with the above plan for
revising the CAGD paper; I'd like to get it done ASAP.

                                           Rida

*************************************************

Rida,
	Sorry for the delay.  I was without access to a terminal until
just now: I am at Stonybrook (Amy has a conference here) and just got set
up in an office.
	I feel fine about leaving the original trimming procedure
in, with a comment about the lack of cusps on the final bisector.
My main concern is that the referee requested `an example illustrating
the need for active/inactive trimming'.
Without an explicit motivation for inflection points (i.e., an example that 
shows a bisector bounded at an inflection point), I don't think the referee
would be satisfied.  How about the following solution?

We can retain the idea of active/inactive points, but exclude inflection points
as endpoints of active segments in Thm 3.1, using the following argument.
The point corresponding to an inflection cannot be the endpoint of an active
segment: in a nhood of the inflection q', the corresp. pt is always active, since
p either lies on the opp. side of the tangent at q'
or inside the circle of curvature at q' (since this is the entire halfplane
or close to the halfplane in a nhood of q').
Thus, inflection pts can be removed from Defn 3.3 and Thm 3.1, but the overall
structure maintained if we add the above observation to the text.
Let me know what you think.

			John

John,
     I agree with your latest argument that inflections
can be ignored during the trimming -- it fits in nicely
with the earlier definition of "active" points. I will
make the appropriate changes.
     I have started hacking away at the paper, and have
shaved of five or six pages already. But it's becoming
more difficult to cut away "fat" without throwing away
the "meat." When will you be back in Baltimore?

John,
      What do you think of the following idea re
the necessity of trimming at cusps:

1) When dealing with a complete curve, defined
   over the entire real line as parameter domain,
   trimming at cusps is not necessary, since the
   trimming at self-intersections & at infinity
   will remove all cusps anyway. Note that a
   "complete" curve must go off to infinity or
   form a closed loop.

2) When dealing with a finite curve segment,
   trimming at cusps becomes important if, say,
   only one of the two parameter values that
   correspond to a self-intersection is within
   the parameter range of that segment.

The above idea is motivated by the fact that
trimming at cusps is a "local" consideration,
while trimming at self-intersections is a "global"
one. Consider a typical "fishtail" as in, for
example, the point/ellipse bisectors, and let
u1 < u2 < u3 < u4 be such that u1 & u4 define
the self-intersection, while u2 & u3 are the
two cusps. If one has an entire ellipse, splitting
at u2 & u3 is not really necessary. But suppose
one only has a finite ellipse segment, that ends
somewhere between u2 & u3. Then, I contend,
splitting at the cusp u2 becomes essential.

  Do you agree? If so, it would clear up the
problem, and we could include such a comment
in the revised paper.
                              Rida

***************************

Rida,
	Great, you have captured exactly where cusps come in.
The ellipse example is indeed the best example, and optimally
we could include an example of a finite segment clipped at a cusp as evidence
of the necessity of cusps.
You are right that, when applying
the convexity argument to rule out cusps, there is an implicit assumption 
that the bisector is closed.
If it isn't closed, then clipping at cusps is consistent with convexity.

Do you want me to wait for a new copy before reading?

		John

John,
      Since you agree, and we now know that (apart from
the inflections, which we've corrected) we were right &
the referee wrong, I don't want to make a big deal about
it in the paper. I'll just modify the paragraph at the
end of Section 3.2 (i.e., after Remark 3.3) to say that
trimming at cusps is essential for finite segments, and
consistent with convexity.
      So you can go ahead and look at the version you
now have. I've read it through carefully myself, and am
pretty confident with it all.

John,
     Unfortunately, I no longer believe my earlier
claim regarding the necessity of trimming at cusps
when bisecting a point and a FINITE curve segment.
In such a case, it is ESSENTIAL to "complete" the
untrimmed bisector using the tangent-extensions at
its end points. When the intersections of these
tangent intersections with the rest of b(u) and
each other are included as "critical" points, the
cusps are always contained within segments that
will be thrown out anyway. At least this is true
in all the examples I've looked at. So it may be
that splitting at cusps is generically redundant.
     Anyway, I've included appropriate verbiage
in the revised paper and mailed it off now, as I'm
thoroughly sick of unearthing new problems every
time I go back to it! One day we'll understand
this cusp business, but for now I'm not ashamed
to be proposing a method with potential redundancy.

                                     Rida
