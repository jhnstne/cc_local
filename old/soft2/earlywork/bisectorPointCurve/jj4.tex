\begin{abstract}
The {\it bisector\/} of a point ${\bf p}$ and a smooth plane curve
$C$ --- {\it i.e.}, the locus traced by a point that remains equidistant
with respect to ${\bf p}$ and $C$ --- is investigated in the case
that $C$ admits a regular polynomial or rational parameterization.
The bisector of ${\bf p}$ and any segment of $C$ can also be computed.
It is shown that the bisector may be regarded as (a
subset of) a ``variable--distance offset'' curve to $C$ which has
the remarkable property, unlike fixed--distance offsets, of being
{\it generically\/} a rational curve. The parametric subsegments
that constitute the true bisector are identified by a ``trimming''
procedure which requires only the ability to isolate and approximate
the real roots of certain polynomials to a prescribed accuracy.
Finally, the irregular points of the bisector curve are analyzed
and are shown to fall into certain well--defined categories.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In descriptive geometry \cite{coxeter69} the parabola is
characterized as the locus traced by a point that remains
equidistant with respect to a fixed point ${\bf p}$ (the
{\it focus\/}) and a given straight line $L$ (the {\it
directrix\/}). Thus, points of the plane that lie to one
side of the parabola are closer to ${\bf p}$ than to $L$,
while those that lie on the other side are closer to $L$
than to ${\bf p}$. In this sense, the parabola may be
regarded as the ``bisector'' of the point ${\bf p}$ and
the line $L$.

If we substitute a smooth plane curve $C$ in place of
the straight line $L$, the bisector locus is of a more
subtle nature. This paper is concerned with investigating
the geometric properties of such loci, and formulating
tractable representations for them. Point/curve bisectors
arise in a variety of geometric ``reasoning'' and geometric
decomposition problems ({\it e.g.}, planning paths of maximum
clearance in robotics or computing Voronoi diagrams for areas
with curvilinear boundaries). 

Although simpler than other
loci --- line/curve and curve/curve bisectors --- that arise
in these contexts, point/curve bisectors have not attracted
much attention in the literature.
However, there has been a considerable amount of interest recently in
the general topic of bisectors.
Yap and Alt \cite{yap89} discuss the complexity of bisector computation of 
algebraic curves, yielding an upperbound of $16m^6$ for curves of degree $m$.
Yap \cite{yap87} discusses the bisector of points, lines, and circles in the 
context of Voronoi diagrams.
Again in the context of building Voronoi diagrams, Held \cite{Held91}
discusses the construction of the bisector of two objects.
Hoffmann and Vermeer \cite{HV91} develop the system of equations that define
equal-distance curves and surfaces (which is another term for the bisector,
viewed as an offset from both curves/surfaces).
Voronoi surfaces (the bisector of two surfaces) are discussed in 
Hoffmann \cite{H90} and Dutta and Hoffmann \cite{DH90}.
Finally, the offset of a curve is closely related to the bisector
and it is directly used in the development of this paper.
Therefore, the papers of Farouki and Neff on plane
offset curves are important \cite{farouki90a,farouki90b}.

\subsection{Regular parametric curves}

We shall focus here on the important case where the curve $C$
is described parametrically, ${\bf r}(u)=\{x(u),y(u)\}$, having
derivatives
\be \label{derivs}
{\bf r}'(u) = \{x'(u),y'(u)\} \,, \quad
{\bf r}''(u) = \{x''(u),y''(u)\} \,, \quad
\ldots {\rm etc.}
\ee
continuous to at least third order for all $u \in I$, where $I$
denotes some finite, semi--infinite, or infinite parameter domain
of interest. We assume that the parameterization of ${\bf r}(u)$
is {\it proper}, {\it i.e.}, there is a one--to--one correspondence
between parameter values $u$ and points $(x,y)$ of the curve
locus --- except, possibly, for finitely many instances where
${\bf r}(u)$ crosses itself.

Since improper parameterizations arise rather infrequently in
practice, and identifying them is not in general a straightforward
matter (see \cite{sederberg84,sederberg86}), we shall not dwell on
this issue. However, we do need to impose an additional constraint
on the parameterization of ${\bf r}(u)$ --- namely that it be {\it
regular\/} over the parameter domain of interest:

\begin{dfn}
The parametric speed of ${\bf r}(u)=\{x(u),y(u)\}$ is the
function
\be \label{sigma}
\sigma(u) = \sqrt{x'^2(u)+y'^2(u)}
\ee
of the parameter $u$, and the curve is said to have a {\it
regular\/} parameterization on the interval $I$ if and only if
$\sigma(u)\not=0$ for all $u \in I$.
\end{dfn}

It should be noted that any polynomial or rational curve that
has an irregular parameterization will not, in general, exhibit
a smooth locus: the points where $\sigma(u)=0$ correspond to
{\it cusps\/} (sudden tangent reversals) or, exceptionally,
discontinuities in higher--order differential characteristics
\cite{farouki91b}.

We denote by $|{\bf v}|$ the Euclidean norm $\sqrt{v_x^2
+v_y^2}$ of a vector ${\bf v}=(v_x,v_y)$. Thus, we shall also
write $|{\bf r}'(u)|$ for the parametric speed of ${\bf r}(u)$,
to suit the context. Since we are concerned solely with {\it
real\/} functions $x(u)$ and $y(u)$ of a {\it real\/} parameter
$u$, we note that $\sigma(u)=0\;\Longleftrightarrow\;x'(u)=
y'(u)=0$.

Although much of the ensuing discussion holds for any regular
parametric curve, we shall deal primarily with the two functional
forms encountered most often in practice: the {\it polynomial\/}
curve ${\bf r}(u)=\{X(u),Y(u)\}$ of degree $n$ defined by
\be \label{polycurve}
X(u) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k u^k \,, \quad
Y(u) = \sum_{k=0}^n b_k u^k \,,
\ee
the coefficients $\{a_k,b_k\}$ being real numbers that satisfy
$a_n^2+b_n^2\not=0$, and the {\it rational\/} curve ${\bf r}(u)=
\{X(u)/W(u),Y(u)/W(u)\}$ of degree $n$, where
\be \label{ratcurve}
X(u) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k u^k \,, \quad
Y(u) = \sum_{k=0}^n b_k u^k \,, \quad
W(u) = \sum_{k=0}^n c_k u^k \,,
\ee
the coefficients $\{a_k,b_k,c_k\}$ being again real numbers
with either $a_n^2+b_n^2\not=0$ or $c_n\not=0$. In (\ref
{ratcurve}) we also assume that there are no factors common
to {\it all three\/} of the polynomials $X,Y,W$, {\it i.e.},
that ${\rm GCD}(X,Y,W) ={\rm constant}$. (${\rm GCD}(\ldots)$
denotes the ``greatest common divisor'' of the indicated set
of polynomials, as determined by one or more applications of
Euclid's algorithm \cite{uspensky48}.)

Since polynomial curves are a special class of rational
curves with $W(u)={\rm constant}$, when we speak specifically
of rational curves it will be understood implicitly that $W(u)
\not={\rm constant}$. Roots of the polynomial $W(u)$ correspond
to ``points at infinity'' on the rational curve (\ref{ratcurve}).
In most applications, we are concerned only with the {\it affine\/}
part of a rational curve, {\it i.e.}, its locus for all parameter
values $u$ such that $W(u)\not=0$.

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
A sufficient and necessary condition for the polynomial curve
$(\ref{polycurve})$ to have a regular parameterization is that
\be \label{regpoly}
{\rm GCD}(X',Y')={\rm constant} \,,
\ee
while in the case of the rational curve $(\ref{ratcurve})$ we
require
\be \label{regrat}
{{\rm GCD}(WX'-W'X,WY'-W'Y) \over {\rm GCD}(W,W')}={\rm constant}
\ee
for the affine locus to have a regular parameterization.
}
\end{rmk}

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
We have already noted the simple nature of the bisector of a point
and a straight line. Another common case that yields an ``elementary''
bisector arises if we take the curve $C$ to be a {\it circle}. Assume,
without loss of generality, that $C$ is of unit radius and centered
on the origin, and let the given point be ${\bf p}=(\alpha,\beta)$.
Then the bisector is evidently the locus of points $(x,y)$ that
satisfy
\be
\left|\,\textstyle{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}-1\,\right|
\,=\, \sqrt{(\alpha-x)^2+(\beta-y)^2} \,,
\ee
where the left-- and right--hand sides represent the distance of
the variable point $(x,y)$ from the circle $C$ and the fixed point
${\bf p}$, respectively. Squaring twice to clear radicals, we see
that the bisector has the implicit equation
\ba \label{ellipse}
& & (1-\alpha^2)\,x^2 \,+\, (1-\beta^2)\,y^2
 \,-\, 2\alpha\beta\,xy \nonumber \\
& & \quad +\ (\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\,(\alpha x+\beta y)
 \,-\, \quarter(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)^2 \,=\, 0
\ea
which clearly represents a conic section. The nature of this conic
may be determined \cite{eisenhart60} by inspecting the signs of the
invariants
\be
k \,=\, (1-\alpha^2)(1-\beta^2) - \alpha^2\beta^2 \,,
\ee
which simplifies to $k=1-(\alpha^2+\beta^2)$, and
\be
D \,=\,
\left| \begin{array}{ccc}
1-\alpha^2 &
-\,\alpha\beta &
%\half\alpha(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) \\ \\
\half(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\alpha \\ \\
-\,\alpha\beta &
1-\beta^2 &
%\half\beta(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) \\ \\
\half(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\beta \\ \\
%\half\alpha(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) &
\half(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\alpha &
%\half\beta(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) &
\half(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\beta &
-\quarter(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)^2
\end{array} \right| \,,
\ee
which gives the value $D=-\,\quarter[\,1-(\alpha^2+\beta^2)\,]^2
=-\,\quarter k^2$ on expansion.

When $k=0$ ({\it i.e.}, the point ${\bf p}$ lies {\it on\/} the circle
$C$), equation (\ref{ellipse}) becomes $(\beta x-\alpha y)^2=0$,
and the bisector degenerates into a straight line --- the normal
to $C$ at ${\bf p}$ --- counted twice. Otherwise, the bisector is
a non--degenerate conic: an ellipse or (one branch of a) hyperbola
according to whether $k>0$ or $k<0$, {\it i.e.}, whether ${\bf p}$ lies
{\it inside\/} or {\it outside\/} $C$. Some examples are illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:circle}.

\subsection{The point/curve distance function}

In characterizing the parabola as the bisector of a point
${\bf p}$ and a straight line $L$, the meaning of the ``distance''
of any point from $L$ is clear: it is simply the length of the
{\it unique\/} perpendicular from the point in question to the
straight line $L$. In substituting a smooth parametric curve $C$
in place of $L$, we need to generalize this notion of distance
(see \cite{kelly79}):

\begin{dfn}
The distance of a point ${\bf q}$ from a regular parametric curve
${\bf r}(u)$ $=\{x(u),y(u)\}$ defined on the parameter interval
$I$ is given by
\be \label{distance}
\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,=\,
\inf_{u \,\in\, I} \, |\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,| \,,
\ee
{\it i.e.}, it is the greatest lower bound, for all $u \in I$, on the distance
measured between the fixed point ${\bf q}$ and each point ${\bf r}(u)$
along the curve.
\end{dfn}

If ${\bf r}(u)$ is a polynomial curve, of course, the bound (\ref
{distance}) is always attained at a {\it finite\/} parameter value
$u$ regardless of whether $I$ has finite or infinite extent. When
${\bf r}(u)$ is a rational curve and $I$ is not finite, however, it
is possible that (\ref{distance}) may be attained in the limit $|u|
\to\infty$ if the degree of $W(u)$ is not less than the greater
of the degrees of $X(u)$ and $Y(u)$.

Consider, for example, the point ${\bf q}=(-2,0)$ and the unit circle
centered on the origin, ${\bf r}(u)=\{\,(1-u^2)/(1+u^2),2u/(1+u^2)\,\}$
for $u \in (-\infty,+\infty)$. The closest point on ${\bf r}(u)$ to
${\bf q}$ is clearly ${\bf r}(\pm\infty)=(-1,0)$.

Note that as $|u|\to\infty$ the rational curve (\ref{ratcurve})
converges to an affine point $(x_\infty,y_\infty)$, where
$|x_\infty|=|a_n/c_n|$ and $|y_\infty| =|b_n/c_n|$, if and only
if ${\rm deg}(W)\ge\max({\rm deg}(X),{\rm deg}(Y))$; otherwise it
has a point at infinity at infinite values of $u$. In the former
case it is always possible to re--parameterize (\ref{ratcurve})
by a bilinear transformation of the parameter so as to make
$(x_\infty,y_\infty)$ correspond to a {\it finite\/} parameter
value.

\begin{propn} \label{polydist}
For the point ${\bf q}=(a,b)$ and the polynomial curve ${\bf r}(u)$
given by $(\ref{polycurve})$, let $\{u_1,\ldots,u_N\}$ be the set of
distinct odd--multiplicity roots of the polynomial
\be \label{Pperp}
P_\perp(u) \,=\,
[\,a-X(u)\,]\,X'(u) \,+\, [\,b-Y(u)\,]\,Y'(u)
\ee
of degree $2n-1$ on the interior of the interval $I$, augmented by
the finite end points, if any, of $I$. Then the distance function
$(\ref{distance})$ may be expressed as
\be \label{distance2}
\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,=\,
\min_{k \,\in\, \{1,\ldots,N\}} \, |\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u_k)\,| \,.
\ee
\end{propn}

\prf On differentiating the expression
\be \label{distsq}
|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,|^2 \,=\,
[\,a-X(u)\,]^2 \,+\, [\,b-Y(u)\,]^2 \,,
\ee
we see that the distance $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,|$ will attain a
``stationary'' value whenever $[\,a-X(u)\,]\,X'(u)\,+\,[\,b-Y(u)\,]
\,Y'(u)=0$, {\it i.e.}, at the roots of the polynomial $P_\perp(u)$.
(Note that, by virtue of the constraint (\ref {regpoly}), this
equation will never be satisfied in the degenerate case $X'(u)=
Y'(u)=0$.) Only those roots of $P_\perp(u)$ that are of {\it odd\/}
multiplicity identify local {\it extrema\/} of $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}
(u)\,|$, however. To evaluate (\ref{distance}) we must compare
the values of $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,|$ at each odd root of
$P_\perp(u)$ on the parameter interval $I$ and at its end points
{\it if\/} they are finite (since $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,| \to
\infty$ for any polynomial curve as $|u|\to\infty$). Then $\dist
({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ is given by the smallest of these values.
\QED

A result analogous to Proposition \ref{polydist} holds for regular
rational curves, provided we replace the odd roots of the polynomial
(\ref{Pperp}) by those of
\ba \label{Rperp}
P_\perp(u)
&=& [\,aW(u)-X(u)\,]\,[\,W(u)X'(u)-W'(u)X(u)\,] \nonumber \\
&+& [\,bW(u)-Y(u)\,]\,[\,W(u)Y'(u)-W'(u)Y(u)\,]
\ea
satisfying $W(u)\not=0$ on the interval $I$. (These roots never
correspond to the degenerate case $W(u)X'(u)-W'(u)X(u)=W(u)Y'(u)-
W'(u)Y(u)=0$ with $W(u)\not=0$ when the constraint (\ref{regrat})
is imposed.)

Thus, in computing $\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ for a rational curve,
we compare the values of the distance $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u)\,|$
at each odd root of (\ref{Rperp}) and at finite end points of the
parameter interval $I$ satisfying $W(u)\not=0$ and/or at infinite
end points in the case that ${\rm deg}(W)\ge\max({\rm deg}(X),
{\rm deg}(Y))$.

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
Note that equations (\ref{Pperp}) and (\ref{Rperp}) have an
obvious geometric interpretation: in each case, the roots of the
polynomial $P_\perp(u)$ identify points of the curve where lines
drawn from ${\bf q}$ meet ${\bf r}(u)$ orthogonally. The distance
(\ref{distance}) is then simply the smallest of the lengths of
these perpendiculars (and the chords drawn from ${\bf q}$ to
the affine end points of ${\bf r}(u)$, if any). We can ignore
points that correspond to even--multiplicity roots of $P_\perp
(u)$, since the tangent does not (locally) lie to one side of
the curve at such points, and consequently the distance between
${\bf q}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ does not attain a local extremum.
Insisting that ${\bf r}(u)$ have a regular parameterization
guarantees that $P_\perp(u)$ will not vanish in degenerate cases
where $x'(u)=y'(u)=0$ (which do not, in general, identify
perpendiculars to ${\bf r}(u)$ from ${\bf q}$).
}
\end{rmk}

The preceding characterizations of the distance function for
polynomial and rational curves extend to arbitrary analytic
curves. In general, we write
\be \label{distance3}
\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,=\,
\min_{k \,\in\, \{1,\ldots,N\}} \, |\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(u_k)\,| \,,
\ee
where $u_1,\ldots,u_N$ identify all the points on the analytic
curve ${\bf r}(u)$ where a line drawn from ${\bf q}$ meets the
curve orthogonally (and the curve does not cross its tangent line),
as well as the affine end points of ${\bf r}(u)$, if any. In the
case of an arbitrary analytic curve, of course, the determination
of these parameter values will generally be more difficult than
isolating and approximating the odd roots of the polynomials
(\ref{Pperp}) and (\ref{Rperp}) in the case of polynomial
and rational curves.

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
For an algebraic curve $C$ defined by the implicit polynomial
equation $f(x,y)=0$, we have
\be
\dist({\bf q},C) \,=\,
\min_{k \,\in\, \{1,\ldots,N\}} \, |\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}_k\,| \,,
\ee
where ${\bf r}_1=(x_1,y_1),\ldots,{\bf r}_N=(x_N,y_N)$ identify all
points on the curve ({\it i.e.}, $f(x_k,y_k)=0$) that satisfy
\be
(a-x)\,f_y(x,y) \,-\, (b-y)\,f_x(x,y) \,=\, 0 \,,
\ee
$f_x$ and $f_y$ being the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect
to $x$ and $y$. The points ${\bf r}_k$ are either singular points
of $f(x,y)=0$ (in the sense of an algebraic curve) or identify
locations on $f(x,y)=0$ where the line drawn from ${\bf q}$ meets
the curve orthogonally (since the tangent at a point of $f(x,y)=0$
is parallel to the vector $(f_y,-f_x)$ \cite[p.~55]{W50}).
} \QED
\end{exmpl}

We now note some important properties of the distance function:

\begin{propn}
When ${\bf r}(u)$ is a regular polynomial or rational curve, the
function $\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ is continuous --- but not
always differentiable --- with respect to the location of the point
${\bf q}$.
\end{propn}

\prf The continuity of $\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ follows immediately
from a more general result, concerning the distance between a point
${\bf q}$ and a non--empty set ${\cal S}$ in a metric space (see \cite
{kelly79}, Theorem 3, p.~53). However, it is instructive to examine
this property in greater detail within the present context. For the
sake of brevity we discuss only the case of a polynomial curve
${\bf r}(u)$ below; the extension to a rational curve is relatively
straightforward.

Consider expression (\ref{Pperp}) as a polynomial in {\it three\/}
variables, namely, the parameter value $u$ and the coordinates
$(a,b)$ of the point ${\bf q}$:
\be \label{Pperp2}
P_\perp(u,a,b) \,=\,
[\,a-X(u)\,]\,X'(u) \,+\, [\,b-Y(u)\,]\,Y'(u) \,.
\ee
At the reference point $(a_0,b_0)$, let $u_{k,0} \in I$ be a simple
root of (\ref{Pperp2}), so that $\partial P_\perp/\partial u\not=0$
when $u=u_{k,0}$. Then by the {\it implicit function theorem\/}
\cite{buck78}, we deduce the existence of a function $\phi_k(a,b)$,
analytic in some two--dimensional neighborhood ${\cal N}_k$ of
$(a_0,b_0)$, such that $\phi_k(a_0,b_0)=u_{k,0}$ and
\be
P_\perp(\phi_k(a,b),a,b) \equiv 0
\quad {\rm for\ all\ } (a,b) \in {\cal N}_k \,.
\ee
Intuitively, the function $\phi_k(a,b)$ describes how the root $u_k$
of $P_\perp(u)$ moves in the vicinity of its nominal value $u_{k,0}$
as the point ${\bf q}=(a,b)$ executes any path within the neighborhood
${\cal N}_k$ of its nominal location ${\bf q}_0=(a_0,b_0)$.

If $u_k$ represents a finite end point of the parameter interval
$I$ on which ${\bf r}(u)$ is defined, rather than a root of (\ref
{Pperp2}), it can be incorporated into the above framework by
simply taking $\phi_k(a,b) \equiv u_k$.

Thus, about any nominal location ${\bf q}_0=(a_0,b_0)$, we may
invoke (\ref{distance2}) to formulate the distance function in a
neighborhood of that location as
\be \label{distance4}
\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,=\,
\min_{k \,\in\, \{1,\ldots,N\}} \,
|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(\phi_k({\bf q}))\,|
\quad {\rm for\ all\ } {\bf q} \in {\cal N} \,,
\ee
where ${\cal N}=\bigcap\,{\cal N}_k$ represents the area common
to each of the neighborhoods of ${\bf q}_0=(a_0,b_0)$ in which the
root functions $\phi_k({\bf q})=\phi_k(a,b)$ are analytic.

In the formulation (\ref{distance4}), the continuity of $\dist
({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ with respect to ${\bf q}=(a,b)$ at the
(arbitrary) reference point $(a_0,b_0)$ is now apparent: each of
the terms
\be \label{distancek}
|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(\phi_k({\bf q}))\,| \,=\,
\sqrt{ \, [\,a-X(\phi_k(a,b))\,]^2 + [\,b-Y(\phi_k(a,b))\,]^2 }
\ee
is continuous with respect to ${\bf q}$ at $(a_0,b_0)$, since the
functions $\phi_k(a,b)$ are analytic there and the curve ${\bf r}(u)=
\{X(u),Y(u)\}$ is continuous everywhere, and although the index $k$
that achieves the minimum in (\ref{distance4}) may suddenly jump
--- from $i$ to $j$, say --- as we move through $(a_0,b_0)$, we
nevertheless have $|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(\phi_i({\bf q}))\,|=|\,{\bf q}
-{\bf r}(\phi_j({\bf q}))\,|$ at any such jump.

If such a jump occurs in traversing $(a_0,b_0)$, however, $\dist
({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ will not, in general, be differentiable with
respect to ${\bf q}$ there. To see why, we consider the {\it
directional derivative}
\be \label{vnabla}
{\bf v}\cdot\!\nabla \; \dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))
\,=\, \left[ \lambda {\partial \over \partial a} +
\mu {\partial \over \partial b} \, \right]
\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,,
\ee
which measures the rate of change of the distance function in the
direction of the unit vector ${\bf v}=(\lambda,\mu)$ at the point
$(a_0,b_0)$ at which the partial derivatives in (\ref{vnabla}) are
evaluated. Now by formal differentiation using the chain rule, and
noting that $P_\perp(\phi_k(a,b),a,b)=0$, the partial derivatives of
the functions $\Delta_k(a,b)=|\,{\bf q}-{\bf r}(\phi_k({\bf q}))\,|$
given by (\ref{distancek}) may be expressed as
\be \label{pderivs}
{\partial\Delta_k \over \partial a}
= {a-X(\phi_k(a,b)) \over \Delta_k(a,b)}
\quad {\rm and} \quad
{\partial\Delta_k \over \partial b}
= {b-Y(\phi_k(a,b)) \over \Delta_k(a,b)} \,.
\ee
In (\ref{pderivs}) it is understood that $k$ represents the index
minimizing $\Delta_k(a,b)$, and if $k$ jumps from $i$ to $j$ on
passing through $(a_0,b_0)$ in the direction ${\bf v}$, it is in
general true that
\be
X(\phi_i(a_0,b_0)) \not= X(\phi_j(a_0,b_0))
\quad {\rm and} \quad
Y(\phi_i(a_0,b_0)) \not= Y(\phi_j(a_0,b_0)) \,,
\ee
although $\Delta_i(a_0,b_0)=\Delta_j(a_0,b_0)$. Therefore, the
magnitude of the derivative (\ref{vnabla}) is discontinuous in
general whenever we traverse a point $(a_0,b_0)$ for which there
is a jump in the index $k$ that realizes the mimimum value on the
right--hand side of expression (\ref{distance2}). \QED

We are now ready to give a formal definition of point/curve bisectors:

\begin{dfn} \label{defbsctr}
The bisector $B({\bf p},C)$ of a point ${\bf p}$ and a plane curve $C$
is the locus traced by a point that remains equidistant with respect
to ${\bf p}$ and $C$, in the sense of the distance function $(\ref
{distance})$.
\end{dfn}

That the bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ does indeed form
a continuous locus can be seen from the preceding discussion. For
if ${\bf q}=(a,b)$ is a point of the bisector for which $\dist
({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$ is realized by a {\it unique\/} index $k$
on the right--hand side of (\ref{distance2}), then the direction
${\bf v}=(\lambda,\mu)$ of an infinitesimal displacement along the
bisector --- {\it i.e.}, the {\it tangent\/} to the bisector at ${\bf q}$
--- is uniquely determined by the requirement of maintaining equal
distance with respect to ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$, namely
\be \label{equidist}
{\bf v}\cdot\!\nabla \; |\,{\bf q}-{\bf p}\,| \,=\,
{\bf v}\cdot\!\nabla \; \dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u)) \,,
\ee
where ${\bf v}\cdot\nabla=\lambda\,\partial/\partial a+\mu\,\partial
/\partial b$ denotes the directional derivative with respect to
${\bf q}=(a,b)$ moving along ${\bf v}$.

\figg{fig:Btangent}{Local tangent direction for the bisector
of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$.}{2.75in}

Now $\nabla\,|\,{\bf q}-{\bf p}\,|$ is simply a unit vector in the
direction of ${\bf q}-{\bf p}$, while $\nabla\,\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}
(u))$ is the unit normal ${\bf n}(u_k)$ to ${\bf r}(u)$ at the
(unique) point $u_k$ thereof for which $\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))$
is realized. Thus, to satisfy (\ref{equidist}), the direction of
the tangent ${\bf v}$ to the bisector at ${\bf q}$ must be such as
to {\it bisect the angle between the vectors ${\bf q}-{\bf p}$ and
${\bf n}(u_k)$} (see Figure~\ref{fig:Btangent}).

This provides a basis for numerically tracing the bisector, if the
parameter value $u_k$ at which $\dist({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))=|\,{\bf q}
-{\bf r}(u_k)\,|$ can be determined for any given ${\bf q}$. If
this value is {\it not\/} unique, a more sophisticated analysis is
required to choose among the possibilities (in general, the tangent
is discontinuous at such points --- the bisector is not smooth,
although it is point--continuous). We shall not pursue this approach
further, however.

\section{Offset curves and bisectors}
\label{offsets}

In formulating a tractable representation for the bisector of a
point ${\bf p}$ and a curve ${\bf r}(u)$, it will be useful to recall
the definition and some basic properties of the {\it offset curves\/}
to ${\bf r}(u)$ (see \cite{farouki90a,farouki90b} for a more thorough
discussion).

\subsection{Constant--distance offsets}

We begin by noting that if the curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is regular on the
interval $u \in I$, its unit normal vector
\be \label{normal}
{\bf n}(u) \,=\, {(y'(u),-x'(u)) \over \sqrt{x'^2(u)+y'^2(u)}}
\ee
is defined and continuous for all $u \in I$.

\begin{dfn}
The untrimmed offset at (signed) distance $d$ to a regular parametric
curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is the locus defined by
\be \label{offset}
{\bf r}_o(u) \,=\, {\bf r}(u) + d\,{\bf n} (u) \,.
\ee
\end{dfn}

Note that when ${\bf r}(u)$ is a polynomial or rational curve,
the offset ${\bf r}_o(u)$ is {\it not}, in general, a polynomial
or rational curve, because of the radical expression in the
denominator of (\ref{normal}). Consequently, the offset curve
is often approximated by piecewise--polynomial forms
in practical computer--aided
design (CAD) applications
\cite
{hoschek88,klass83,pham88,tiller84},
to render it compatible with their
representational and algorithmic infrastructure. (The ``interior''
and ``exterior'' offsets, at distances $-d$ and $+d$, together form
an {\it algebraic curve\/} with an implicit polynomial equation
$f_o(x,y)=0$ \cite{farouki90b}. See also \cite{farouki90c,farouki91a}
for discussion of a special class of polynomial curves whose offsets
{\it are\/} rational.)

We call the locus (\ref{offset}) the ``untrimmed'' offset for the
following reason: {\it Corresponding points\/} ${\bf r}(u)$ and
${\bf r}_o(u)$ on the given curve and its untrimmed offset are
evidently distance $d$ apart, measured along their mutual normal
direction. However, the point ${\bf r}_o(u)$ of the untrimmed offset
is not necessarily distance $d$, in the sense of the distance function
(\ref{distance}), from the {\it entire curve\/} ${\bf r}(u)$. We call
the locus having this latter property the ``trimmed'' offset to
${\bf r}(u)$, since it is obtained by deleting certain continuous
segments of (\ref{offset}).

The trimming procedure may be characterized by the following
property of the untrimmed offset curve (\ref{offset}):

\begin{propn} \label{offtrim}
For a regular polynomial or rational curve ${\bf r}(u)$ defined on
the interval $u \in I$, let $\{i_1,\ldots,i_M\}$ be the ordered set
of parameter values on $I$ that correspond to self--intersections
of its untrimmed offset ${\bf r}_o(u)$ at distance $d$, {\it i.e.},
${\bf r}_o(i_j)={\bf r}_o(i_k)$ for some $1 \le j \not= k \le M$.
Then, denoting the end points of $I$ by $i_0$ and $i_{M+1}$, we
have either
\be
\dist({\bf r}_o(t),{\bf r}(u)) \,\equiv\, d \quad {\rm for\ all\ }
t \in (i_k,i_{k+1})
\ee
or
\be
\dist({\bf r}_o(t),{\bf r}(u)) \,<\, d \quad {\rm for\ all\ }
t \in (i_k,i_{k+1})
\ee
on each span $(i_k,i_{k+1})$ for $k=0,\ldots,M$ between successive
self--intersections of the untrimmed offset.
\end{propn}

\prf See Theorem 4.4 in \cite{farouki90a}. \QED

Proposition \ref{offtrim} indicates that if we dissect the
untrimmed offset ${\bf r}_o(u)$ into the subsegments delineated by
its self--intersections, then each subsegment should be retained
or discarded in its entirety in forming the trimmed offset. It is
sufficient to test the distance of a single point interior to each
span $(i_k,i_{k+1})$ of ${\bf r}_o(u)$ from the given curve ${\bf r}
(u)$ (the mid point $\half(i_k+i_{k+1})$, say) to determine whether
or not that span should be eliminated (see Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}).

\figg{fig:offsets}{Untrimmed and trimmed offsets to a parabola.}
{2.75in}

Note that trimming an offset curve is a problem in the {\it global
topology\/} of the locus defined by (\ref{offset}); we know of no
simpler algorithm for the trimming process than the methodical
dissect--and--test procedure described above.

The fact that the untrimmed offset (\ref{offset}) is {\it not\/} a
rational curve complicates somewhat the problem of determining the
parameter values ${i_1,\ldots,i_M}$ of its self--intersections; see
\cite{farouki90b}. We shall encounter a similar ``trimming'' problem
in computing point/curve bisectors which, surprisingly, proves to be
simpler because the untrimmed curve happens to be rational (see below).

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
The trimmed offsets at distance $\pm d$ to a given curve ${\bf r}(u)$
are the ``level curves'' for the point/curve distance function $(\ref
{distance})$, {\it i.e.}, they are the loci of points ${\bf p}$ that satisfy
$\dist({\bf p},{\bf r}(u))=|d|$.
}
\end{rmk}

\subsection{The untrimmed point/curve bisector}
\label{sec:untrim}

We can generalize the notion of an (untrimmed) offset curve at fixed
distance $d$ to a given regular curve ${\bf r}(u)$ by substituting
any continuous function $d(u)$ of the parameter $u$ in place of the
constant $d$. The differentiability of the {\it variable--distance
offset curve}
\be \label{varoffset}
{\bf r}_o(u) \,=\, {\bf r}(u) + d(u) {\bf n}(u)
\ee
is then constrained by that of the ``displacement function'' $d(u)$.
We shall find the form (\ref{varoffset}) to be valuable in analyzing
point/curve bisectors.

Consider the {\it family of normal lines\/} to a given regular curve
${\bf r}(u)$. These lines may be parameterized in the form
\be \label{nline}
{\bf r}(u) + \lambda\,{\bf n}(u) \,,
\ee
where $u$ selects a point on the curve, and $\lambda$ measures the
signed distance along the normal line from that point. Given any point
${\bf p}$ not on ${\bf r}(u)$, the location ${\bf q}$ along the normal
line (\ref{nline}) that is equidistant from ${\bf p}$ and the curve
point ${\bf r}(u)$ is uniquely identified by the condition $|\,{\bf q}
-{\bf r}(u)\,|=|\,{\bf q}-{\bf p}\,|$, or
\be \label{lambda}
\lambda \,=\, |\,{\bf r}(u)+\lambda\,{\bf n}(u)-{\bf p}\,| \,.
\ee

\figg{fig:du}{Definition of the displacement function $d(u)$.}{2.75in}

Now for each $u$, let $d(u)$ denote the unique value $\lambda$
satisfying condition (\ref{lambda}), and let $\psi(u)$ be the angle
between the vector from ${\bf r}(u)$ to ${\bf p}$ and the normal
${\bf n}(u)$, measured in the right--handed sense defined by a unit
vector ${\bf z}$ orthogonal to the plane of the curve. Referring to
Figure~\ref{fig:du} and noting that the points ${\bf p}$, ${\bf q}$,
and ${\bf r}(u)$ define an isosceles triangle, we have
\be \label{du0}
d(u) \,=\, \half\,|\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,|\sec\psi(u) \,.
\ee
Since $({\bf p}-{\bf r}(u))\dotpr{\bf n}(u)=|\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,|
\cos\psi(u)$, we can also express $d(u)$ as
\be \label{du}
d(u) \,=\, {|\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,|^2 \over
2\,({\bf p}-{\bf r}(u))\dotpr{\bf n}(u)} \,.
\ee
If we regard the tangent line to the curve at ${\bf r}(u)$ as dividing
the plane into two halves, it is evident from (\ref{du}) that $d(u)$
will be positive or negative according to whether or not ${\bf p}$
lies in the half--plane that ${\bf n}(u)$ points in to.

Note that (\ref{du}) is {\it not\/} (in general) a rational function
of $u$, because of the radical incurred in computing the unit normal
vector ${\bf n}(u)$.

\begin{dfn}
The {\it untrimmed bisector\/} of a fixed point ${\bf p}$ and a
regular parametric curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is the variable--distance offset
$(\ref{varoffset})$ to ${\bf r}(u)$ with the displacement function
$(\ref{du})$.
\end{dfn}

Thus, the untrimmed bisector --- the parametric curve defined by
(\ref{varoffset}) and (\ref{du}) --- is simply the locus of points
on the normal lines (\ref{nline}) that are equidistant from each curve
point ${\bf r}(u)$ and the given point ${\bf p}$ (see Figure~\ref
{fig:du}). We will show below that it is appropriately named, {\it
i.e.}, it is a {\it superset\/} of the true bisector $B({\bf p},
{\bf r}(u))$. Figure~\ref{fig:varoffset} illustrates the formulation
of untrimmed bisectors as variable--distance offsets in the simple
case of a parabola.

\figg{fig:varoffset}{Untrimmed bisectors as variable--distance offsets.}
{2.75in}

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
When ${\bf r}(u)$ is a polynomial or rational curve, the untrimmed
bisector defined by $(\ref{varoffset})$ and $(\ref{du})$ has a
{\it rational\/} parameterization, since the radicals in $d(u)$
and ${\bf n}(u)$ cancel precisely.
}
\end{rmk}

Note that the displacement function satisfies $d(u)\not=0$ for
all $u$ if the given point ${\bf p}$ does not lie on the curve
${\bf r}(u)$. However, at each parameter value $\tau$ such that
$({\bf p}-{\bf r}(\tau))\dotpr{\bf n}(\tau)=0$ ({\it i.e.}, the curve
normal at ${\bf r}(\tau)$ is orthogonal to the vector from ${\bf r}
(\tau)$ to ${\bf p}$ --- or, equivalently, the tangent at ${\bf r}
(\tau)$ passes through ${\bf p}$) the untrimmed bisector exhibits a
``point at infinity.'' For the polynomial curve (\ref{polycurve}),
the parameter values corresponding to these points at infinity are
the roots of the polynomial
\be \label{Pinf}
P_\infty(u) \,=\,
[\,\alpha-X(u)\,]\,Y'(u) \,-\, [\,\beta-Y(u)\,]\,X'(u) \,,
\ee
which is of degree $2n-1$ (at most) when ${\bf r}(u)$ is of
degree $n$. Similarly, for the rational curve (\ref{ratcurve}),
the polynomial whose roots identify points at infinity on the
untrimmed bisector is
\ba \label{Rinf}
P_\infty(u)
&=& [\,\alpha W(u)-X(u)\,]\,[\,W(u)Y'(u)-W'(u)Y(u)\,] \nonumber \\
&-& [\,\beta  W(u)-Y(u)\,]\,[\,W(u)X'(u)-W'(u)X(u)\,] \,.
\ea
The roots of (\ref{Rinf}) identify only the {\it affine\/} points of
${\bf r}(u)$ that induce points at infinity on the untrimmed bisector
--- assuming that (\ref{regrat}) holds. In addition, points at infinity
of ${\bf r}(u)$, corresponding to the roots of $W(u)$, will give rise
to points at infinity on the untrimmed bisector.

We will denote the untrimmed bisector defined by (\ref{varoffset})
and (\ref{du}) by ${\bf b}(u)$, with homogeneous coordinates given
by the polynomials $X_b(u)$, $Y_b(u)$, $W_b(u)$. For the polynomial
curve (\ref{polycurve}), it may be verified that
\ba \label{pbsctr}
X_b &=& [\,\alpha^2-X^2+(\beta-Y)^2\,]\,Y'
 \,-\, 2(\beta-Y)XX' \,, \nonumber \\
Y_b &=& 2(\alpha-X)YY'
 \,-\, [\,(\alpha-X)^2+\beta^2-Y^2\,]\,X' \,, \nonumber \\
W_b &=& 2\,[\,(\alpha-X)Y'-(\beta-Y)X'\,] \,,
\ea
while in the case of the rational curve (\ref{ratcurve}) we have
\ba \label{rbsctr}
X_b &=& [\,\alpha^2W^2-X^2+(\beta W-Y)^2\,]\,V
 \,-\, 2(\beta W-Y)XU \,, \nonumber \\
Y_b &=& 2(\alpha W-X)YV
 \,-\, [\,(\alpha W-X)^2+\beta^2W^2-Y^2\,]\,U \,, \nonumber \\
W_b &=& 2W\,[\,(\alpha W-X)V-(\beta W-Y)U\,] \,,
\ea
where $U=WX'-W'X$ and $V=WY'-W'Y$. Note that $W_b \propto P_\infty$
in the case of a polynomial curve, while $W_b \propto WP_\infty$ in
the rational case.

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
It may be verified from (\ref{pbsctr}) and (\ref{rbsctr}) that when
${\bf r}(u)$ is a {\it polynomial\/} curve of degree $n$, the untrimmed
bisector ${\bf b}(u)$ is a rational curve of degree $3n-1$ at most,
whereas if ${\bf r}(u)$ is a {\it rational\/} curve of degree $n$, the
untrimmed bisector is of degree $4n-1$ at most.
}
\end{rmk}

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
The simplest polynomial curve, other than a straight line, is the
parabola. Consider the case ${\bf p}=(\alpha,\beta)$ and ${\bf r}(u)=
(u,u^2)$. From equations (\ref{pbsctr}), we have the representation
\ba \label{Bprbla}
X_b(u) &=& 2u\,[\,u^4-2\beta u^2+\alpha^2+\beta^2-\beta\,] \,,
\nonumber \\
Y_b(u) &=& -\ 3u^4+4\alpha u^3-u^2+2\alpha u-\alpha^2-\beta^2 \,,
\nonumber \\
W_b(u) &=& -\ 2u^2+4\alpha u-2\beta \,,
\ea
for the untrimmed bisector, which is evidently a rational curve of
degree {\it five}. Note that the roots of the denominator polynomial
$W_b(u)$ are simply
\be \label{uinfprbla}
u \,=\, \alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2-\beta}
\ee
which identify real points at infinity of (\ref{Bprbla}) at {\it finite\/}
parameter values if $\beta<\alpha^2$ ({\it i.e.}, $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies
``outside'' the parabola). Since $\max({\rm deg}(X_b),{\rm deg}(Y_b)) >
{\rm deg}(W_b)$, the parameter values $u=\pm\infty$ also identify points
at infinity on the untrimmed bisector (\ref{Bprbla}), regardless of
the location $(\alpha, \beta)$. Figure~\ref{fig:parabola} illustrates
representative examples of the curves (\ref{Bprbla}).
} \QED

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
As a simple example of the untrimmed bisector of a point and a rational
curve, we consider the case of an ellipse centered on the origin, with
semi--axes 1 and $k$. This has the rational parameterization
\be \label{pellipse}
X(u) \,=\, 1-u^2 \,, \quad
Y(u) \,=\, 2k\,u \,, \quad
W(u) \,=\, 1+u^2 \,.
\ee
Substituting the above into (\ref{rbsctr}), we find that the untrimmed
bisector is a rational curve of degree {\it six}, defined by
\ba \label{Bellps}
X_b(u) &=& (1-u^2)\,
[\, k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)u^4 \,+\, 4(1-k^2)\beta u^3 \nonumber \\

Y_b(u) &=& 2\,u\,
[\, (\alpha^2+\beta^2+2(1-k^2)\alpha+1-2k^2)u^4 \nonumber \\

W_b(u) &=& 2(1+u^2)^2\,
[ -\,k(\alpha+1)u^2 \,+\, 2\beta u \,+\, k(\alpha-1) \,] \,.

In this case, the untrimmed bisector has real points at infinity only
when the condition $\alpha^2+(\beta/k)^2>1$ is satisfied, {\it i.e.},
when $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it outside\/} the ellipse. They occur at
the parameter values
\be \label{uinfellps}
u \,=\, {\beta \pm \displaystyle{\sqrt

\subsection{Irregular points of the untrimmed bisector}

It is evident from Figures~\ref{fig:parabola} and \ref{fig:ellipse}
that in general the untrimmed bisector of a point ${\bf p}$ and a
regular curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is {\it not\/} a smooth locus, even though
${\bf r}(u)$ is necessarily smooth if it has a regular parameterization.

Recall \cite{kreyszig59} that for any regular parametric curve
${\bf r}(u)$, the elementary differential characteristics at each
point may be expressed in terms of the parametric derivatives
${\bf r}'(u),{\bf r}''(u),\ldots$ there as
\be \label{diffchar}
{\bf t} \,=\, {{\bf r}' \over |{\bf r}'|} \,, \quad
{\bf n} \,=\, {\bf t} \cross {\bf z} \,, \quad
\kappa \,=\, {({\bf r}' \cross {\bf r}'') \dotpr {\bf z}
  \over |{\bf r}'|^3} \,,
\ee
${\bf z}$ being a unit vector orthogonal to the plane of the curve.
The {\it normal\/} ${\bf n}(u)$ and {\it tangent\/} ${\bf t}(u)$ form
an orthonormal basis $({\bf n},{\bf t},{\bf z})$ with ${\bf z}$ at
each point $u$, while $\kappa(u)$ is the (signed) {\it curvature}.
The variation of the tangent and normal along the curve is described
by the {\it Frenet equations\/}:
\be \label{frenet}
{\bf t}' \,=\, -\,\sigma\kappa\,{\bf n}
\quad {\rm and} \quad
{\bf n}' \,=\, \sigma\kappa\,{\bf t} \,,
\ee
where $\sigma$ is the parametric speed (\ref{sigma}) of ${\bf r}(u)$.
Higher-order derivatives of ${\bf t}(u)$ and ${\bf n}(u)$ are readily
expressed in terms of the vectors ${\bf t}(u)$, ${\bf n}(u)$ and the
scalar functions $\sigma(u)$, $\kappa(u)$ and their derivatives; for
example
\ba \label{frenet2}
{\bf t}'' &=& -\,\sigma^2\kappa^2\,{\bf t} \,-\,
(\sigma'\kappa+\sigma\kappa')\,{\bf n} \,, \nonumber \\
{\bf n}'' &=& (\sigma'\kappa+\sigma\kappa')\,{\bf t}
 \,-\, \sigma^2\kappa^2\,{\bf n} \,.
\ea

If we denote by ${\bf b}(u)$ the parametric representation of the
untrimmed bisector obtained by substituting from (\ref{du}) into
(\ref{varoffset}), then the parametric derivatives of ${\bf b}(u)$
may be written as
\ba \label{bderivs}
{\bf b}' &=& {\bf r}' \,+\,
  d'\,{\bf n} \,+\, d\,{\bf n}' \,, \nonumber \\
{\bf b}'' &=& {\bf r}'' \,+\,
  d''\,{\bf n} \,+\, 2d'\,{\bf n}' \,+\, d\,{\bf n}'' \,,
\ea
$\ldots$ etc. By substituting from (\ref{frenet}) and (\ref{frenet2}),
we can re--write (\ref{bderivs}) as
\ba \label{bderivs2}
{\bf b}' &=& \sigma(1+\kappa d\,)\,{\bf t} \,+\, d'\,{\bf n} \,,
 \nonumber \\
{\bf b}'' &=&
[\,\sigma'(1+\kappa d\,)+\sigma(\kappa'd+2\kappa d')\,]\,{\bf t}
 \nonumber \\
 & & \quad +\ [\,d''-\sigma^2\kappa(1+\kappa d\,)\,]\,{\bf n} \,,
\ea
where, using the form (\ref{du0}), the derivatives of the displacement
function $d(u)$ appropriate to the untrimmed bisector are most
conveniently expressed in the form
\ba \label{dderivs}
d'  &=& -\ \sigma(1+\kappa d\,)\tan\psi \,,
\nonumber \\
d'' &=& -\ [\,\sigma'(1+\kappa d\,)+\sigma\kappa'd\,]\tan\psi
\nonumber \\
    & & \quad +\ {\sigma^2(1+\kappa d\,) \over 2d}
    \,[\,1+2\kappa d+(1+4\kappa d)\tan^2\psi\,] \,,
\ea
$\ldots$ etc. In deriving (\ref{dderivs}), we make use of the fact
that the angle $\psi$ between the vector from ${\bf r}(u)$ to ${\bf p}$
and the curve normal ${\bf n}(u)$ changes at the rate
\be \label{psideriv}
\psi' \,=\, -\,{\sigma(1+2\kappa d\,) \over 2d}
\ee
with respect to $u$, as may be deduced by differentiating expression
(\ref{du0}).

Using the above expression for $d'$, we now see that the first
parametric derivative of the untrimmed bisector has the form
\be \label{bprime}
{\bf b}' \,=\, \sigma(1+\kappa d\,)\,({\bf t}-{\bf n}\tan\psi) \,.
\ee
At each value of $u$ such that ${\bf b}'(u)\not={\bf 0}$, the
tangent ${\bf t}_b(u)$ to the untrimmed bisector is a unit vector
in the direction of (\ref{bprime}). Note that the magnitude of (\ref
{bprime}) is simply
\be \label{magbprime}
|{\bf b}'| \,=\, \sigma\,|1+\kappa d\,|\,|\!\sec\psi| \,.
\ee

Since the given curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is regular, its unit tangent
and normal ${\bf t}(u)$ and ${\bf n}(u)$ are defined and linearly
independent at each $u$, so that ${\bf t}(u)-{\bf n}(u)\tan\psi(u)$
is never the zero vector. Moreover, this vector varies continuously
with $u$ except at those parameter values where $\psi(u)=\pm\pi/2$,
which correspond to the roots of the polynomial (\ref{Pinf}), {\it
i.e.}, the points at infinity on ${\bf b}(u)$. Therefore, at each
$u$ such that $P_\infty(u)\not=0$, the unit vector
\be \label{evector}
{\bf e}(u) \,=\, |\!\cos\psi(u)| \,
[\,{\bf t}(u)-{\bf n}(u)\tan\psi(u)\,]
\ee
in the direction of ${\bf t}(u)-{\bf n}(u)\tan\psi(u)$ is well
defined and varies continuously with $u$. Since for a regular curve
$\sigma(u)\not=0$ for all $u$, we may deduce from (\ref{diffchar})
that the tangent to the untrimmed bisector is given in terms of
${\bf e}(u)$ by
\be \label{btangent}
{\bf t}_b(u) \,=\,
{1+\kappa(u)d(u) \over |\,1+\kappa(u)d(u)\,|} \; {\bf e}(u) \,.
\ee

\begin{lma}
The untrimmed bisector ${\bf b}(u)$ exhibits a cusp, or sudden
tangent reversal, at those parameter values where $P_\infty(u)
\not=0$ and the curvature $\kappa(u)$ of the given curve ${\bf r}
(u)$ attains the local critical value
\be \label{kappacrit}
\kappa_c(u) \,=\, -\ {1 \over d(u)} \,=\,
-\ {2\cos\psi(u) \over |\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,|} \,,
\ee
without being an extremum, {\it i.e.}, $\kappa'(u)\not=0$.
\end{lma}

\prf Let $\tau$ be a parameter value such that $P_\infty(\tau)\not
=0$ ({\it i.e.}, ${\bf b}(\tau)$ is an affine point of the untrimmed
bisector), and the curvature of the given curve ${\bf r}(u)$ satisfies
both $\kappa(\tau)=-1/d(\tau)$ and $\kappa'(\tau)\not=0$. Then $\tan
\psi(\tau)$ is finite, and the unit vector ${\bf e}(\tau)$ given by
(\ref{evector}) is defined and continuous at $u=\tau$. On the other
hand, the scalar factor multiplying ${\bf e}(u)$ in (\ref{btangent})
is a ``step function,'' which changes abruptly from $-1$ to $+1$,
or vice--versa, at $u=\tau$ whenever $d/du\,(1+\kappa(u)d(u))\not=0$
at $u=\tau$, {\it i.e.}, $\kappa'(\tau)d(\tau)+\kappa(\tau)d'(\tau)
\not=0$. But from (\ref{dderivs}) we observe that $d'(\tau)=0$
whenever $\kappa(\tau)=-1/d(\tau)$, and since we certainly have
$d(\tau)\not=0$ because ${\bf p}$ does not lie on ${\bf r}(u)$,
the condition $d/du\,(1+\kappa(u)d(u))\not=0$ at $u=\tau$ is
exactly equivalent to $\kappa'(\tau)\not=0$. \QED

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
It is interesting to note that the criteria $\kappa(u)=-1/d(u)$
and $\kappa'(u)\not=0$ identifying the cusps of the ``variable
offset'' $(\ref{varoffset})$ are identical to those for a simple
offset ($\kappa(u)=-1/d$, $\kappa'(u)\not=0$) with $d(u)={\rm constant}$
$\cite{farouki90a}$. This is not a {\it generic} feature of variable
offsets, but arises rather from the specific form $(\ref{du})$ of
$d(u)$ for the untrimmed bisector.
}
\end{rmk}

The local critical curvature (\ref{kappacrit}) is attained at those
roots of the equation
\be \label{cuspeqn}
|\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,|^2\,{\bf r}'(u)\cross{\bf r}''(u) \,+\,
2\,|{\bf r}'(u)|^2\,[\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)\,]\cross{\bf r}'(u)
\,=\, 0
\ee
that satisfy $\kappa'(u)\not=0$. These parameter values correspond
to cusps on the untrimmed bisector ${\bf b}(u)$. When ${\bf r}(u)$
is the polynomial curve (\ref{polycurve}), equation (\ref{cuspeqn})
corresponds to a polynomial of degree $4(n-1)$ (at most) in $u$:
\ba \label{Pcusp}
P_c(u) &=& [\,(\alpha-X)^2+(\beta-Y)^2\,]\,(X'Y''-X''Y') \nonumber \\
&& +\ 2\,({X'}^2+{Y'}^2)\,[\,(\alpha-X)Y'-(\beta-Y)X'\,] \,.
\ea
If ${\bf r}(u)$ is the rational curve (\ref{ratcurve}), the left--hand
side of (\ref{cuspeqn}) is a rational function in $u$, whose numerator
is a polynomial of degree $7n-6$ (at most) in $u$:
\ba \label{Rcusp}
P_c(u) &=& W\,[\,(\alpha W-X)^2+(\beta W-Y)^2\,]\,(U_1V_2-U_2V_1)
\nonumber \\
&& +\ 2\,(U_1^2+V_1^2)\,[\,(\alpha W-X)V_1-(\beta W-Y)U_1\,] \,,
\ea
where we denote $(WX'-W'X,WY'-W'Y)$ and $(WX''-W''X,WY''-W''Y)$ by
$(U_1,V_1)$ and $(U_2,V_2)$ for brevity.

Consider now the behavior of the curvature $\kappa_b(u)$ along the
untrimmed bisector. By substituting from (\ref{bderivs2}) and (\ref
{dderivs}), a straightforward but laborious calculation gives
\be
({\bf b}'\cross{\bf b}'')\dotpr{\bf z}
\,=\, {\sigma^3(1+\kappa d\,)^2 \over 2d}
\,[\,(1+4\kappa d\,)\tan^2\psi-1\,] \,,
\ee
and together with (\ref{magbprime}) the expression $\kappa_b(u)=
|{\bf b}'(u)|^{-3}[\,{\bf b}'(u)\cross{\bf b}''(u)\,]\dotpr{\bf z}$
for the curvature of the untrimmed bisector reduces to
\be \label{bkappa}
\kappa_b \,=\, {(1+4\kappa d\,)\tan^2\psi \,-\, 1
 \over 2d\,|1+\kappa d\,|\,|\!\sec\psi|^3} \,.
\ee
It is worthwhile emphasizing the significance of equation (\ref
{bkappa}) in words: at any point $u$ on the untrimmed bisector, we
can express the curvature $\kappa_b(u)$ of ${\bf b}(u)$ simply in
terms of the curvature $\kappa(u)$ of the given curve ${\bf r}(u)$,
the displacement function $d(u)$ defined by (\ref{du}), and the
angle $\psi(u)$ between the vector ${\bf p}-{\bf r}(u)$ and the
curve normal ${\bf n}(u)$.

\begin{lma}
In general, the untrimmed bisector ${\bf b}(u)$ has an extraordinary
point --- {\it i.e.}, a tangent--continuous point of infinite curvature
--- at those parameter values $u$ where $P_\infty(u)\not=0$ and
the curvature $\kappa(u)$ of the given curve ${\bf r}(u)$ attains
a local extremum $(\kappa'(u)=0\ but\ \kappa''(u)\not=0)$, equal
in value to the critical curvature $-\,1/d(u)$ defined by $(\ref
{kappacrit})$.
\end{lma}

\prf Let $\tau$ be such that $P_\infty(\tau)\not=0$ and the
curvature of ${\bf r}(u)$ satisfies $\kappa(\tau)=-1/d(\tau)$ with
$\kappa'(\tau)=0$ and $\kappa''(\tau)\not=0$. Then the unit vector
${\bf e}(\tau)$ given by (\ref{evector}) is continuous at $u=\tau$
and, by the same arguments as in the preceding Lemma, the scalar
factor $(1+\kappa d\,)/|1+\kappa d\,|$ multiplying it in (\ref
{btangent}) is of the {\it same\/} sign on either side of $\tau$.
Therefore, ${\bf t}_b(u)$ is continuous at $u=\tau$. However, since
$1+\kappa(\tau)d(\tau)=0$, it is evident from (\ref{bkappa}) that
the curvature $\kappa_b(u)$ of the untrimmed bisector increases
without bound as we approach $\tau$ (since the numerator of (\ref
{bkappa}) is, in general, non--zero at such a point). \QED

\subsection{The true bisector}

We now show that the untrimmed bisector given by (\ref{varoffset}) and
(\ref{du}) is a superset of the ``true'' bisector (Definition~\ref
{defbsctr}).
Note that the ``true'' bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ can be visualized
as follows.
Consider a circle through ${\bf p}$,
increasing in size until it just touches the curve ${\bf r}(u)$.  
Now consider all such circles, inflating in all directions from ${\bf p}$.
The bisector is the locus of the centers of these maximal circles.
In the following discussion, it is useful to keep this representation
of the bisector in mind.

\begin{dfn}
Let $C_{\bf q}$ denote the circle with center ${\bf q}$ and radius
$|{\bf p}-{\bf q}|$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:bis}
{\rm
A point ${\bf q}$ lies on the bisector of ${\bf p}$ and the regular
curve ${\bf r}(u)$ if and only if (see Figure~\ref{fig:bis}):
\begin{itemize}
\item
$C_{\bf q}$ is ``empty'' --- no point of ${\bf r}(u)$ lies in its
interior; and
\item
$C_{\bf q}$ is tangent to ${\bf r}(u)$ in at least one point.
\end{itemize}
%       If ${\bf r}(u)$ is not regular,
%       then the second condition should instead be
%       that the boundary of the circle $C_{\bf q}$
%       contains at least one point of ${\bf r}(u)$.
}
\end{rmk}
\prf
${\bf q}$ lies on the bisector if and only if the closest point
of ${\bf r}(u)$ to ${\bf q}$ is at distance $|\,{\bf p}-{\bf q}\,|$.
If $C_{\bf q}$ is tangent to ${\bf r}(u)$ at $u=u_0$ but otherwise
empty, then ${\bf r}(u_0)$ is closest to ${\bf q}$ and is at distance
$|\,{\bf p}-{\bf r}(u_0)\,|=|\,{\bf p}-{\bf q}\,|$.
\QED

\figg{fig:bis}{Condition for a point ${\bf q}$ to lie on the bisector
$B({\bf p},{\bf r}(u))$.}{2.75in}

(Note that if we are computing the bisector of a point and a finite
curve segment, the circle $C_{\bf q}$ may contain curve points that
correspond to parameter values outside the domain $I$ that defines
the segment of interest.)

\begin{propn}
\label{p:superset}
The untrimmed bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ is a superset
of the true bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$.
\end{propn}
\prf
Let ${\bf q}$ be a point of the bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$.
By Remark~\ref{rmk:bis}, there exists a point ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ of the
curve that lies on the circle $C_{\bf q}$, such that the curve is tangent
to the circle at ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ or, equivalently, such that the normal
at ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ passes through the center ${\bf q}$ of the circle
$C_{\bf q}$. Thus, ${\bf r}(u_{0}) + d(u_{0}){\bf n}(u_{0}) = {\bf q}$
(recall that $d(u_0)=|\,{\bf q}-{\bf p}\,|={\rm radius\ of\ } C_{\bf q}$).
\QED

Since the second condition of Remark~\ref{rmk:bis} is satisfied for
{\it all\/} points ${\bf q}$ of the untrimmed bisector (by definition),
a point ${\bf q}$ of the untrimmed bisector is a point of the bisector
if and only if the interior of $C_{\bf q}$ is empty.

\section{The trimming procedure}
\label{trimming}

The untrimmed bisector ${\bf b}(u)$ may be ``trimmed'' down to the true
bisector by deleting a finite number of segments. As with the untrimmed
offset, this is done by finding a finite number of special points that
identify possible deviations of ${\bf b}(u)$ from the true bisector.
There are four classes of these special points on the untrimmed bisector
(Definitions~\ref{d:trim} and \ref{d:cri}), and we split the trimming
process into two stages. We now describe the first stage, which removes
``inactive'' segments.

Along the normal line to every curve point ${\bf r}(u_0)$, there is a
corresponding point ${\bf b}(u_0)$ of the untrimmed bisector. Many of
these points ${\bf b}(u_0)$ do not belong to the true bisector, however,
because ${\bf r}(u_0)$ is clearly not the closest point of the curve to
${\bf b}(u_0)$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:notclosest}).

\figg{fig:notclosest}{${\bf r}(u_0)$ is not closest on ${\bf r}(u)$ to
its corresponding point ${\bf b}(u_0)$.}{2.75in}

\begin{dfn}
The points ${\bf r}(u_0)$ and ${\bf b}(u_0) = {\bf r}(u_0) +
d(u_0){\bf n}(u_0)$ are called
{\rm corresponding} points.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}
The point ${\bf q} = {\bf b}(u_{0})$ of the untrimmed bisector is
{\rm active} if either of the following conditions holds:
\begin{description}
\item[(1)]
        ${\bf q}$ has more than one corresponding point on the
        curve\footnote{There are only a finite number of such points,
        and we will have much more to say about them below.}
\item[(2)]
        ${\bf q}$ has only one corresponding point ${\bf q}' =
        {\bf r}(u_0)$ on the curve, and either:
\begin{description}
\item[(a)]
        ${\bf p}$ and the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$
        lie on opposite sides of the tangent at ${\bf q'}$, or
\item[(b)]
        the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$ contains ${\bf p}$
        (i.e., ${\bf p}$ lies on or inside the circle of curvature).
\end{description}
\end{description}
(See Figure~\ref{fig:active}.)
A segment $S$ of ${\bf b}(u)$ is active if every point of $S$ is active.
\end{dfn}

\figg{fig:active}{Active points on the untrimmed bisector.}{2.75in}

\begin{rmk}
\label{r:active}
{\rm
We observe that an active point appears to lie on the bisector, at least
locally. To see this,
let ${\bf q}$ be an active point of ${\bf b}(u)$ with only one corresponding
point ${\bf q}'$.
If ${\bf p}$ lies inside or on the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$,
then all of $C_{\bf q}$ also lies in the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$
and, in particular, there exists a neighborhood of ${\bf q}'$
% ({\it i.e.}, the image of a neighborhood of $t'$ where ${\bf q}' = {\bf r}(t')$)
that lies completely outside of $C_{\bf q}$ \cite[p.~176]{H52}.
On the other hand, if ${\bf p}$ (and thus $C_{\bf q}$) lies on the opposite side
of the tangent at ${\bf q}'$ from the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$,
then again the curve in a neighborhood of ${\bf q}'$ lies completely outside of
$C_{\bf q}$.
Thus, the curve in some neighborhood of an active point (with one corresponding
point) lies completely outside of $C_{\bf q}$.
In other words, an active point acts at least locally
like a point of the bisector (Remark~\ref{rmk:bis}).
}
\end{rmk}

\begin{propn}
An inactive point of the untrimmed bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$
does not lie on the bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$.
\end{propn}
\prf
Let ${\bf q}$ be an inactive point of ${\bf b}(u)$
and let ${\bf q}'$ be the point corresponding to ${\bf q}$.
By definition, ${\bf p}$ and the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$ lie
on the same side of the tangent at ${\bf q}'$, but ${\bf p}$ lies outside this
circle (Figure~\ref{fig:active}(ii)).
$C_{\bf q}$ and the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$ are both circles that are
tangent to ${\bf q}'$ (or equivalently, circles with a center on the normal at ${\bf q}'$)
and they both lie on the same side of this tangent.
Moreover, $C_{\bf q}$ must be strictly larger than (and strictly contain)
the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$, because it reaches ${\bf p}$ while the circle
of curvature does not.
But all circles tangent at ${\bf q}'$ that are larger than the circle of curvature
at ${\bf q}'$ must lie on one side of the curve in the neighborhood of ${\bf q}'$
\cite[p.~176]{H52} and consequently $C_{\bf q}$ must contain some points of the curve
in its interior.
We conclude that ${\bf q}$ is not on the bisector (Remark~\ref{rmk:bis}).
\QED

Since the definition of an active point depends on the side of the tangent
(at ${\bf q}'$) that ${\bf p}$ and the circle of curvature lie on,
we are interested in points where this can change.

\begin{dfn}
\label{d:trim}
A point ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ of a curve is an {\rm inflection} point
if the curvature at ${\bf r}(u_0)$ is zero.
% regular curve => no cusps, no advantage in avoiding self-intersections
% concavity of the curve changes at this point
A point of the curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is a {\rm class}
point\footnote{This
        term is chosen in allusion to the class of a curve, which is the
        number of tangents that hit a typical point not on the curve.}
if its tangent intersects the point ${\bf p}$.
A point of the curve ${\bf r}(u)$ is a {\rm circular} point
if its circle of curvature intersects ${\bf p}$.
Equivalently, a point ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ is circular
if its center of curvature is ${\bf b}(u_{0})$.
\end{dfn}

We have already encountered ``class'' points and ``circular'' points,
in a somewhat different guise (see Section~\ref{sec:untrim}): they
are, respectively, the points of ${\bf r}(u)$ that induce points at
infinity and cusps on the untrimmed bisector. Thus, for fixed $u$,
equations (\ref{Pinf}) and (\ref{Rinf}) may be regarded as expressing
the condition for the point ${\bf p}=(\alpha,\beta)$ to lie on the
tangent line at location ${\bf r}(u)$ on a polynomial or rational
curve. Likewise, for fixed $u$, equations (\ref{Pcusp}) and (\ref
{Rcusp}) are satisfied when ${\bf p}=(\alpha,\beta)$ lies on the
circle of curvature to the location ${\bf r}(u)$ on a polynomial or
rational curve. (Note that the circle of curvature has radius $\kappa
^{-1}(u)$ and is centered on the point ${\bf r}(u)+\kappa^{-1}(u)
{\bf n}(u)$, the normal ${\bf n}(u)$ and curvature $\kappa(u)$
being defined by (\ref{diffchar}).)

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:active}
For a regular polynomial or rational curve or curve segment
${\bf r}(u)$ defined on the interval
$u \in I$, and a point ${\bf p}$ not on ${\bf r}(u)$,
let ${\bf b}(u)$ be the untrimmed bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$,
and let $\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}\}$ be the ordered set of parameter values on $I$
that correspond to inflection points, class points, and circular points
of ${\bf r}(u)$.
Then, denoting the end points of $I$ by $i_{0}$ and $i_{M+1}$, we have
either
\be
{\bf b}(t) {\rm \ is\ active\ } \quad {\rm for\ all\ } t \in (i_k,i_{k+1})
\ee
or
\be
{\bf b}(t) {\rm \ is\ not\ active\ } \quad {\rm for\ all\ } t \in (i_k,i_{k+1})
\ee
on each span $(i_k,i_{k+1})$ for $k=0,\ldots,M$.
\end{thm}
\prf
Consider moving a point ${\bf q}$ smoothly along the untrimmed bisector
({\it i.e.}, such that the parameter value changes smoothly).
By definition, in order to change from an active point to an inactive point,
or vice versa, one of the following must occur:
${\bf p}$ must move to a different side of the tangent at ${\bf q}'$,
the circle of curvature at ${\bf q}'$ must move to a different side of
the tangent
at ${\bf q}'$, or ${\bf p}$ must move to a different side of the circle
of curvature
at ${\bf q}'$ ({\it i.e.}, from inside to outside or vice versa).
The points associated with these occurrences are, respectively,
the class points, inflection points, and circular points.
Therefore, if ${\bf q}$ does not pass through a point with parameter value associated
with one of these special points, its active/inactive status will not change.
\QED

\begin{rmk}
Consider the computation of the endpoints of active segments.
Inflection points are the roots of $\kappa(u) = 0$, using the formula
(\ref{diffchar}) for the curvature $\kappa(u)$ at the point ${\bf r}(u)$.
Recall that a point ${\bf r}(u_{0})$ is circular
if its center of curvature is ${\bf b}(u_{0})$.
Since the center of curvature of ${\bf r}(u)$ is 
${\bf r}(u) + \kappa^{-1}(u) {\bf n}(u)$,
and the point of ${\bf b}(u)$ corresponding to ${\bf r}(u)$ is
${\bf r}(u) + d(u) {\bf n}(u)$, the circular points are the points
${\bf r}(u_0)$ where $u_0$ is a root of 
\be
\frac{1}{\kappa(u)} = d(u)
\ee
Finally, the class points are the points ${\bf r}(u_0)$ where $u_0$ is a 
root of
\be
({\bf p} - {\bf r}(u)) \cdot {\bf n}(u) = 0
\ee
i.e., ${\bf p} - {\bf r}(u_0)$ is the tangent vector at ${\bf r}(u_0)$.
\end{rmk}

In order to make the second (and final) refinement from active segments
to segments on the bisector,
recall that a point ${\bf q}$ of the untrimmed bisector is in the bisector
if and only if its associated circle $C_{\bf q}$ is empty.
A boundary between the bisector and the rest of the untrimmed bisector
is marked by a transition from points with empty circles to points
with non-empty circles.
These transitions are associated with critical points.

\begin{dfn}
\label{d:cri}
A point ${\bf b}(u_{0})$ of the untrimmed bisector is a {\rm critical} point
if the circle $C_{{\bf b}(u_0)}$
is tangent to ${\bf r}(u)$ at two or more points (Figure~\ref{fig:critical}).
\end{dfn}

\figg{fig:critical}{}{2.75in}

Although defined differently, critical points are actually self--intersections
of the untrimmed bisector.

\begin{propn}
\label{prop:cri}
A point ${\bf b}(u_0)$ of the untrimmed bisector is a
critical point if and only if it is a self-intersection of ${\bf b}(u)$.
\end{propn}

\prf Let ${\bf q} \in {\bf b}(u)$ be a critical point, and let
the circle $C_{\bf q}$
be tangent to ${\bf r}(u)$ at the two points ${\bf r}(u_1)$ and ${\bf r}(u_2)$.
The normal at ${\bf r}(u_1)$ intersects the center of
$C_{\bf q}$ and, since both ${\bf r}(u_1)$
and ${\bf p}$ lie on the boundary of this circle, a point of
the normal is equidistant
from these two points at the center (Figure~\ref{fig:critical}).
Thus, ${\bf b}(u_{1}) = {\bf q}$.
Similarly, ${\bf b}(u_{2}) = {\bf q}$; so ${\bf q}$ is a self-intersection
of ${\bf b}(u)$.

Let ${\bf b}(u_{1}) = {\bf b}(u_{2})$ be a self-intersection.
${\bf p}$, ${\bf r}(u_{1})$, and ${\bf r}(u_{2})$ are all equidistant from
${\bf b}(u_{1})$.
Thus, the circle $C_{{\bf b}(u_{1})}$
contains ${\bf r}(u_{1})$ and ${\bf r}(u_{2})$.
Moreover, since the normals at ${\bf r}(u_{1})$ and ${\bf r}(u_{2})$
intersect the center ${\bf b}(u_{1})$ of this circle,
the circle is also tangent to the curve at
${\bf r}(u_{1})$ and ${\bf r}(u_{2})$.
\QED

Proposition~\ref{prop:cri} allows us to trim using self-intersections
while arguing the validity of this trim using critical points.

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:trim2}
For a regular polynomial or rational curve or curve segment
${\bf r}(u)$ defined on the interval
$u \in I$, and a point ${\bf p}$ not on ${\bf r}(u)$,
let ${\bf b}(u)$ be the untrimmed bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$,
and let $\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{M}\}$ be the ordered set of parameter values on $I$
that correspond to endpoints of active segments on ${\bf b}(u)$
or self-intersections of ${\bf b}(u)$,
{\it i.e.}, ${\bf b}(i_j) = {\bf b}(i_k)$ for some $1 \leq j \neq k \leq M$.
On an active segment $(b(i_j), b(i_k))$, $i_{j} < i_{k}$,
%       Let $i_{j} < i_{k}$ be the parameter values of the endpoints of an
%       active  segment. Then, either
\be
{\bf b}(t) {\rm \ is\ on\ the\ bisector\ }
\quad {\rm for\ all\ } t \in (i_l,i_{l+1})
\ee
or
\be
{\bf b}(t) {\rm \ is\ not\ on\ the\ bisector\ }
\quad {\rm for\ all\ } t \in (i_l,i_{l+1})
\ee
on each span $(i_l,i_{l+1})$ for $l=j,\ldots,k-1$ between successive
self-intersections on the active segment.
\end{thm}

\prf
Let ${\bf b}(u_{1})$ and ${\bf b}(u_{2})$ be two points
on an active segment of the untrimmed bisector ($u_1 < u_2$),
neither of them self-intersections,
${\bf b}(u_{1})$ on the bisector but
${\bf b}(u_{2})$ not on the bisector.
We shall show that the segment ${\bf b}(u_1,u_2)$ between ${\bf b}(u_{1})$
and ${\bf b}(u_{2})$
must contain a self-intersection ({\it i.e.}, a critical point) $\alpha$.
In other words, if an active subsegment of ${\bf b}(u)$ does not contain a
self-intersection, it either lies entirely on or entirely off the bisector.

Since ${\bf b}(u_{1})$ lies on the bisector,
$C_{{\bf b}(u_{1})}$ touches the curve at the point ${\bf r}(u_{1})$
corresponding to ${\bf b}(u_{1})$
{\it and} $C_{{\bf b}(u_{1})}$ is empty (Remark~\ref{rmk:bis}).
As a point ${\bf q}$ moves along the untrimmed bisector from ${\bf b}(u_{1})$
towards ${\bf b}(u_{2})$,
the radius of the circle $C_{\bf q}$ changes smoothly
while maintaining contact with $p$,
and at all times the neighborhood of the corresponding point ${\bf q}'$ lies
completely outside of $C_{\bf q}$ (Remark~\ref{r:active}).
In order to leave the bisector, the circle $C_{\bf q}$ must become full, {\it i.e.},
the curve must enter $C_{\bf q}$ (Remark~\ref{rmk:bis}).
We also know that this eventually happens, because ${\bf b}(u_{2})$
is not on the bisector.
Since the curve in the neighborhood of ${\bf q}'$ does not enter $C_{\bf q}$
% this is important because otherwise in the limit the curve might touch
% {\it and} enter at ${\bf q}'$, {\it e.g.}, inflection.
and the curve is regular,
the curve cannot enter $C_{\bf q}$ at ${\bf q}'$
and must first enter $C_{\bf q}$ at ${\bf q}'' \neq {\bf q}'$.
In order to enter $C_{\bf q}$, the curve must first become tangent to $C_{\bf q}$,
and this position of ${\bf q}$ is a critical point of the untrimmed
bisector, since its circle has two points of tangency with the curve, one
at ${\bf q}'$ and one at the point where the curve is about to enter the circle
(Figure~\ref{fig:critical}).
Thus, the segment ${\bf b}(u_1,u_2)$ contains a critical point.
\QED

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
If the desired interpretation for the bisector of a point ${\bf p}$
and a curve segment $S = r(I)$ of ${\bf r}(u)$ is
\be
        \{\,{\bf q}\ |\ {\rm dist}({\bf q},{\bf p})
                = {\rm dist}({\bf q},{\bf r}(u))
                {\rm \ and\ the\ closest\ point\ of\ }
                {\bf r}(u) {\rm \ to \ } {\bf q} {\rm \ lies\ on\ } S \,\} \,,
\ee
rather than its usual meaning
\be
        \{\,{\bf q}\ |\ {\rm dist}({\bf q},{\bf p}) =
            {\rm dist}({\bf q},S) \,\} \,,
\ee
then the statement of Theorem~\ref{thm:trim2} is unchanged except that,
rather than using self-intersections of the segment ${\bf b}(I)$
({\it i.e.}, self-intersections ${\bf b}(u_1) = {\bf b}(u_2)$
where $u_1, u_2 \in I$),
one should use all self-intersections of ${\bf b}(u)$ that lie on
the segment ${\bf b}(I)$
({\it i.e.}, self-intersections ${\bf b}(u_1) = {\bf b}(u_2)$
where $u_1 \in I$ but $u_2$ need not lie on $I$).
}

We now have an algorithm for computing the bisector of a point
${\bf p}$ and a regular parametric curve ${\bf r}(u)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
        Compute the untrimmed bisector of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$,
        using (\ref{varoffset}) and (\ref{du}).
        For the polynomial and rational curve, this untrimmed bisector
        is given by (\ref{pbsctr}) and (\ref{rbsctr}), respectively.
\item
        Find the inflection points, class points, and circular points
        of the curve ${\bf r}(u)$.
\item
        For each segment on the untrimmed bisector defined by these
        special points, compare the distance of the midpoint of this
        segment from ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ (using (\ref{distance2}))
        and discard the segment if these distances are not equal.
\item
        Find the self-intersections of the untrimmed bisector
        (using (\ref{Iresltnt})).
\item
        Split each remaining segment of the untrimmed bisector
        at these self-intersections, and for each of the resulting
        segments: compare the distance of the midpoint of this
        segment from ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf r}(u)$ (using (\ref{distance2}))
        and discard the segment if these distances are not equal.
        The remaining segments are the bisector.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Self--intersections}

We have seen that the untrimmed bisector of a point ${\bf p}$ and
a polynomial or rational curve ${\bf r}(u)$ of degree $n$ is a
rational curve ${\bf b}(u)$ of degree $m=3n-1$ (if ${\bf r}(u)$
is polynomial) or $m=4n-1$ (if ${\bf r}(u)$ is rational).

A self--intersection of the untrimmed bisector ${\bf b}(u)$ arises
when two or more distinct parameter values correspond to the same
geometric point on its locus (with this definition we include the
exceptional cases where ${\bf b}(u)$ ``touches'' itself among the
self--intersections).

In order to compute the self--intersections, we are interested in
identifying all parameter values $u$ that satisfy the vector equation
\be \label{selfint}
{\bf b}(u+\xi) \,=\, {\bf b}(u) \quad {\rm for\ some\ } \xi\not=0 \,.
\ee
Let $X_b(u)$, $Y_b(u)$, and $W_b(u)$ be the polynomials that give the
homogeneous coordinates of ${\bf b}(u)$, according to (\ref{pbsctr})
or (\ref{rbsctr}), as appropriate. Then we have:

\begin{propn}
Let polynomials $P_k(u)$ and $Q_k(u)$ be defined in terms of $X_b(u)$,
$Y_b(u)$, $W_b(u)$ and their $r$--th derivatives $X_b^{(r)}(u)$,
$Y_b^{(r)}(u)$, $W_b^{(r)}(u)$ by
\ba \label{pkandqk}
P_k(u) &=& {W_b(u)X_b^{(k+1)}(u)-W_b^{(k+1)}(u)X_b(u) \over (k+1)!} \,,
\nonumber \\
Q_k(u) &=& {W_b(u)Y_b^{(k+1)}(u)-W_b^{(k+1)}(u)Y_b(u) \over (k+1)!}
\ea
for $k=0,\ldots,m-1$. Then the parameter values that satisfy $(\ref
{selfint})$ coincide with the roots of the polynomial $I(u)$ defined
by the determinant
\be \label{Iresltnt}
I \,=\, \left|\, \matrix{
 P_0 &P_1 &\cdot &\cdot &P_{m-1} &{} &{} &{} \cr
 {} &P_0 &P_1 &\cdot &\cdot &P_{m-1} &{} &{} \cr
 {} &{} &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &{} \cr
 {} &{} &{} &P_0 &P_1 &\cdot &\cdot &P_{m-1} \cr
 Q_0 &Q_1 &\cdot &\cdot &Q_{m-1} &{} &{} &{} \cr
 {} &Q_0 &Q_1 &\cdot &\cdot &Q_{m-1} &{} &{} \cr
 {} &{} &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &\cdot &{} \cr
 {} &{} &{} &Q_0 &Q_1 &\cdot &\cdot &Q_{m-1} \cr } \,\right| \,.
\ee
\end{propn}

\prf Equation (\ref{selfint}) corresponds to the simultaneous scalar
equations
\ba \label{pandq}
P(u,\xi) &=&
{W_b(u)X_b(u+\xi)-W_b(u+\xi)X_b(u) \over \xi} \,=\, 0 \nonumber \\
Q(u,\xi) &=&
{W_b(u)Y_b(u+\xi)-W_b(u+\xi)Y_b(u) \over \xi} \,=\, 0
\ea
where the division by $\xi$ eliminates the trivial solution $\xi=0$ from
the numerators of expressions (\ref{pandq}), which does not correspond
to a self--intersection. Now by expanding $X_b(u+\xi)$, $Y_b(u+\xi)$,
$W_b(u+\xi)$ as (terminating) Taylor series in $\xi$, we can re--write
$P(u,\xi)$ and $Q(u,\xi)$ as polynomials of degree $m-1$ in $\xi$ whose
coefficients are the polynomials (\ref{pkandqk}) in $u$:
\be \label{pandq2}
P(u,\xi) \,=\, \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} P_k(u)\,\xi^k
\quad {\rm and} \quad
Q(u,\xi) \,=\, \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Q_k(u)\,\xi^k \,.
\ee
Thus, we are interested in the values of $u$ at which the polynomials
(\ref{pandq2}) have a common root $\xi$. It is well known (see, for
example, \cite{uspensky48}) that the vanishing of the ``resultant''
of these polynomials with respect to $\xi$ expresses a sufficient and
necessary condition for them to have a common root. This resultant,
which we write symbolically as
\be \label{Pslfint}
I(u) \,=\, {\rm Resultant}_\xi (\,P(u,\xi),Q(u,\xi)\,) \,,
\ee
is a polynomial expression in the coefficients $P_k(u)$ and $Q_k(u)$
in (\ref{pandq2}), {\it i.e.}, it is a polynomial $I(u)$ in $u$. Equation
(\ref{Iresltnt}) expresses this resultant as a Sylvester determinant
in the polynomials $P_k(u)$ and $Q_k(u)$, one of several equivalent
determinantal forms for the resultant. \QED

\figg{fig:trimprbla}{True bisectors of a point and a parabola.}{2.75in}

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
Consider the ``self--intersection'' polynomial (\ref{Pslfint}) for
the case of Example \ref{offsets}.1 --- {\it i.e.}, the bisector of the
point ${\bf p}=(\alpha,\beta)$ and the parabola ${\bf r}(u)=(u,u^2)$.
The resultant (\ref{Pslfint}) is then of degree 4 in $u$:
\be \label{Iprbla}
I(u) \,=\, u^4-2\beta u^2+\alpha^2+\beta^2-\beta \,.
\ee
Since $I(u)$ is of biquadratic form, its roots can be written down
explicitly as
\be \label{uselfint}
u \,=\, \pm \, \sqrt{ \beta \pm \sqrt{\beta-\alpha^2} } \,.
\ee
All four roots are complex if $\alpha^2>\beta$, {\it i.e.}, the point
$(\alpha,\beta)$ lies ``outside'' the parabola. In this case, however,
it is necessary to trim the untrimmed bisector at the parameter values
(\ref{uinfprbla}) corresponding to its points at infinity.

If $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies ``inside'' the parabola $(\alpha^2<\beta)$,
we have either two or four real roots (and, correspondingly, one or two
real self--intersections) according to whether $\beta$ is less than or
greater than $\sqrt{\beta-\alpha^2}$. The latter condition gives
\be
\alpha^2+\beta^2-\beta \,=\, 0
\ee
as the locus defining the transition between regimes of one and two
self--intersections of the untrimmed bisector as the point $(\alpha,
\beta)$ is varied --- this locus is simply the {\it circle of curvature\/}
at the vertex $(0,0)$ of the parabola. (When $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies on
this circle, $u=0$ is a {\it double root\/} of (\ref{Iprbla}) and the
corresponding point $(x,y)=(0,\half)$ is an {\it irregular point\/} of
the untrimmed bisector --- the remaining roots of (\ref{Iprbla}) are
then simply $u=\pm\sqrt{2\beta}$.)

Figure~\ref{fig:trimprbla} shows the true point/parabola bisectors that
correspond to the untrimmed bisectors seen in Figure~\ref{fig:parabola},
obtained by trimming the latter at the self--intersection points (\ref
{uselfint}) or points at infinity (\ref{uinfprbla}), as appropriate.

\end{exmpl}

\figg{fig:trimellps}{True bisectors of a point and an ellipse.}
{5.5in}

\begin{exmpl}
{\rm
For the ellipse (\ref{pellipse}), the self--intersection polynomial
$I(u)$ is the product of two quartic factors given by
\ba \label{Iellps}
I_1(u) &=&
(\alpha^2+\beta^2+2(1-k^2)\alpha+1-2k^2)u^4 \nonumber \\
&& \!\!\!+\ 2(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)u^2 \,+\, \alpha^2+\beta^2
-2(1-k^2)\alpha+1-2k^2 \,, \\
I_2(u) &=&
k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)u^4 \,+\, 4(1-k^2)\beta u^3 \nonumber \\
&& \!\!\!+\ 2k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-3+2k^2)u^2
\,+\, 4(1-k^2)\beta u \,+\, k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) \,. \nonumber
\ea
In order to clarify the meaning of these equations, note that (\ref
{pellipse}) has radii of curvature $r=k^2$ at the vertices $u=0$ and
$u=\pm\infty$, and $r=1/k$ at the vertices $u=-1$ and $u=+1$. Thus,
the corresponding circles of curvature are given by the equations
\ba \label{ecircles}
C_0(x,y) &=& (x-1+k^2)^2 + y^2 - k^4 \,=\, 0 \,, \nonumber \\
C_\infty(x,y) &=& (x+1-k^2)^2 + y^2 - k^4 \,=\, 0 \,, \nonumber \\
C_{-1}(x,y) &=& x^2 + (y^2-k+1/k)^2 - 1/k^2 \,=\, 0 \,, \nonumber \\
C_{+1}(x,y) &=& x^2 + (y^2+k-1/k)^2 - 1/k^2 \,=\, 0 \,.
\ea

Consider first $I_1(u)$, which we regard as a quadratic in $u^2$.
Making use of the polynomials defined in (\ref{ecircles}), we see
that $I_1(u)$ can be expressed as
\be \label{Iellipse2}
I_1(u) \,=\, C_\infty(\alpha,\beta)\,u^4
\,+\, 2(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)u^2 \,+\, C_0(\alpha,\beta) \,.
\ee
Evidently there are no real values of $u^2$ (and hence of $u$) that
satisfy $I_1(u)=0$, unless its discriminant, given by $\Delta_1=
(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)^2-C_\infty(\alpha,\beta)C_0(\alpha,\beta)$, is
non--negative. From (\ref{ecircles}) it can be seen that $\Delta_1$
factors to yield
\be \label{discrim1}
\Delta_1 \,=\, (1-k^2)(k^2-k^2\alpha^2-\beta^2) \,,
\ee
and hence the condition $\Delta_1 > 0$ may be interpreted geometrically
as follows: either (i) the point $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it inside\/}
the ellipse and the $x$--axis is the major axis of the ellipse ($k<1$),
or (ii) the point $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it outside\/} the ellipse and
the $y$--axis is its major axis ($k>1$). Exceptionally, we have $\Delta=0$
when $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it on\/} the ellipse (note that $k\not=1$
by assumption).

Case (i): $k<1$ and $k^2\alpha^2+\beta^2<k^2$ (major axis along
$x$--axis, point inside ellipse; note that $C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty
(x,y)$ do not intersect if $k<1$). Since we are interested only in
non--negative roots $u^2$ to (\ref{Iellipse2}), we can invoke
{\it Descartes' Law of Signs\/} \cite[pp.~121--124]{uspensky48} to
deduce the number of {\it positive\/} roots merely by inspecting its
coefficients. Specifically, when $k<1$ and $k^2\alpha^2+\beta^2<k^2$,
the middle term of (\ref{Iellipse2}) is necessarily negative, and the
signature of the coefficients of this quadratic equation is either
$+-+$, indicating two positive values for $u^2$, when $(\alpha,\beta)$
lies {\it outside\/} both $C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty(x,y)$, or either
$--+$ or $+--$, indicating just one positive value for $u^2$, when
$(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it inside\/} $C_0(x,y)$ or $C_\infty(x,y)$.
Exceptionally, there is a real root $u^2$ to (\ref{Iellipse2}) at
zero or at infinity if $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it on\/} $C_0(x,y)$
or $C_\infty(x,y)$.

Case (ii): $k>1$ and $k^2\alpha^2+\beta^2>k^2$ (major axis along
$y$--axis, point outside ellipse --- here the circles of curvature
$C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty(x,y)$ intersect, the ellipse being contained
within their intersection). In this case the middle term of (\ref
{Iellipse2}) is necessarily positive and we have three possibilities
for the number of positive real roots $u^2$: (a) signature $+++$,
and thus no positive roots, if $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it outside\/}
both $C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty(x,y)$; (b) signature $-++$ or $++-$,
and thus one positive root, if $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it inside\/}
one of $C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty(x,y)$ and {\it outside\/} the other;
and (c) signature $-+-$, and thus two positive roots, if $(\alpha,
\beta)$ lies {\it inside\/} both $C_0(x,y)$ and $C_\infty(x,y)$ (yet
outside the ellipse). As before, there is a zero or infinite root
$u^2$ to (\ref{Iellipse2}) when $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it on\/}
$C_0(x,y)$ or $C_\infty(x,y)$.

In the case $\Delta_1>0$, the parameter values that identify
self--intersections of the untrimmed bisector are given explicitly
by the formula
\be
u \,=\, \pm \; \sqrt{ 1-\alpha^2-\beta^2 \,\pm\,
\sqrt{\Delta_1} \over C_\infty(\alpha,\beta) } \,,
\ee
which defines zero, one, or two pairs of real values of equal magnitude
and opposite sign, according to the criteria enumerated above.

Consider next $I_2(u)$. We note first that $I_2(u)$ has real roots
(other than zero and infinity) only when $I_1(u)$ has none, and
conversely. To see this, we find by ``completing the square'' that
$I_2(u)$ may be re--written in the form
\be \label{I2new}
I_2(u) \,=\, {
\left[\,k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)(u^2+1)+2(1-k^2)\beta u\,\right]^2
\,+\, 4\Delta_1\,u^2 \over k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1) } \,,
\ee
where $\Delta_1$ denotes the discriminant (\ref{discrim1}) introduced
previously. For fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$, expression (\ref{I2new}) is
evidently of constant sign for all real $u$ when $\Delta_1>0$, and thus
it has no real roots. If $\Delta_1<0$, however, the two terms in the
numerator of (\ref{I2new}) are of opposite sign, and there are real
values of $u$ that will cause them to cancel precisely. These values
identify the self--intersections of the untrimmed bisector when (i)
the point $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies {\it outside\/} the ellipse and the
$x$--axis is the major axis ($k<1$), or (ii) the point $(\alpha,\beta)$
lies {\it inside\/} and the $y$--axis is its major axis ($k>1$).

When $\Delta_1<0$, the real roots of $I_2(u)$ can be computed using
two quadratic equations obtained from (\ref{I2new}), namely
\be \label{I2new2}
k(\alpha^2+\beta^2-1)\,(u^2+1) \,+\,
2\,[\,(1-k^2)\beta \pm \textstyle{\sqrt{-\Delta_1}}\,]\,u \,=\, 0 \,,
\ee
whose real solutions are readily determined. However, it will be
found --- not unexpectedly --- that the number and locations of the
self--intersections identified by (\ref{I2new2}), in relation to the
ellipse and the untrimmed bisector, are actually identical to those
obtained through an appropriate rotation and scaling of the results
for $\Delta_1>0$. Thus, regardless of the orientation of the ellipse,
we may summarize as follows:

When $(\alpha,\beta)$ is located {\it inside\/} the ellipse, we have
either one or two self--intersections of the untrimmed bisector according
to whether or not $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies outside the (disjoint) circles of
curvature to the ellipse at the points on its major axis. When $(\alpha,
\beta)$ is located {\it outside\/} the ellipse, we have either zero, one,
or two self--intersections according to whether $(\alpha,\beta)$ lies
outside both, just one, or neither of the (intersecting) circles of
curvature to the ellipse at the points on its minor axis. In the latter
case, the untrimmed bisector will also need to be trimmed at its points
at infinity, as identified by (\ref{uinfellps}).

The preceding discussion clarifies the behavior seen in Figure~\ref
{fig:ellipse} above; the trimmed bisectors corresponding to those
examples, computed by the methods described above, are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:trimellps}.
} \QED
\end{exmpl}

\begin{rmk}
{\rm
Note that for the parabola, $I(u)$ is a factor of the polynomial $X_b(u)$
in the parametric form (\ref{Bprbla}) of the untrimmed bisector, while for
the ellipse $I_1(u)$ and $I_2(u)$ are factors of $Y_b(u)$ and $X_b(u)$ in
the parameterization (\ref{Bellps}). This means that the self--intersections
of the untrimmed bisector lie on {\it axes of symmetry\/} of the curves
under consideration, namely, $x=0$ in the case of the parabola, and the
major or minor axis of the ellipse according to whether $(\alpha,\beta)$
lies inside or outside it.
