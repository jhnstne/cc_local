Let A and B be closed, simple surfaces whose interiors have no intersection.
Suppose that we are interested in visual events that abruptly reveal A.

\begin{defn2}
A {\bf ruled surface} is a surface that is generated by sweeping a line through space.
Any line on a ruled surface is called a {\bf generator}.
A {\bf bitangent plane} of A and B is a plane that is tangent to both A and B.
A pair of surfaces may have several one-parameter families of bitangent planes.
A {\bf bitangent developable} of A and B is the envelope of a one-parameter family of 
bitangent planes of A and B.
We will typically define a bitangent developable of A and B by a lofting between 
its curves of tangency with A and B: $(1-s)C_1(t) + sC_2(t)$.
Given a subsegment $S = C_1[a,b]$ of one of the bitangent developable's curves of 
tangency,
the generators through S generate a subpatch $(1-s)C_1[a,b] + sC_2[a,b]$, 
which we call the {\bf S-patch}.
The {\bf A-early patch} of a bitangent developable of A and B is the infinite patch 
starting at the curve of tangency with A and moving away from B.
The {\bf middle patch} of a bitangent developable is the patch between its curves 
of tangency.
The {\bf B-early patch} of a bitangent developable of A and B is the infinite patch 
starting at the curve of tangency with B and moving away from A.
The {\bf middle segment} of a generator of a bitangent developable is the segment between 
its points of tangency with A and B.
A bitangent developable of A and B is {\bf inner} if it separates A and B.
A bitangent developable of A and B is {\bf outer} if A and B lie entirely on the same
side of this bitangent developable.
These developables will be called AB-inner and AB-outer if we want to emphasize
the underlying surfaces.
\end{defn2}

For a pair of spheres, the AB-inner developable is a cone and the AB-outer developable
is a cylinder.

Given a bitangent developable (computed using intersection of tangential surfaces), 
an algorithm for determining the type (inner, outer or neither) of this developable is ---

Consider two spheres A and B.
A visual event for A is defined by the B-early patch of the AB-outer developable.
Consider the addition of a third sphere C to the scene.
The earlier visual event will be moved if and only if C intersects the middle patch
of the AB-outer developable.
Let D be the curve of tangency on C of the BC-inner developable.
Let E be the curve of tangency on C of the AC-outer developable.
Let $D'$ be the subsegment of D that lies inside the AB-outer developable.
Let $E'$ be the subsegment of E that lies inside the AB-outer developable.
Let F be the B-early portion of the $D'$-patch of the BC-inner developable, and
let G be the $E'$-patch of the AC-outer developable.

\begin{claim}
1) When C interferes with the middle patch of the AB-outer developable,
the visual event behind B is expanded to F.
How does it combine with the old visual boundary, 
the B-early patch of the AB-outer developable?

2) This new visual boundary is clipped by G.  
   Specify exactly how.
\end{claim}

Open problem from SoCG04: 
Given two spheres from a set of arbitrary spheres (non-intersecting), 
do these two spheres have a free bitangent plane?
Want a very quick answer.
